# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- `view DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` and wrote seven required artifacts.

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
This seed iteration is planning-only per prompt requirements, so execution focused on producing a concise, verifiable backlog and handoff artifacts.
