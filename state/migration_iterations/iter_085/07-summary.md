# Summary

Created iteration `iter_085` and completed one scoped migration-artifact cleanup task.
The task normalized a remaining escaped fallback-error command snippet in `iter_083/01-task.md`.
Only one line changed in the target historical artifact.
Targeted validation confirmed normalized `uv run python` wording and a minimal diff.
The change was committed immediately after verification to satisfy auto-commit requirements.
No runtime code paths, APIs, or behavior were modified.
Risk remains limited to deferred cleanup of similar historical escaped snippets.
A single concrete next task was documented for `iter_083/03-execution.md`.
This keeps migration-iteration cleanup incremental, auditable, and low risk.
