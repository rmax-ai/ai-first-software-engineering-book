# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Minimal risk: this iteration touched historical migration artifacts only and did not affect runtime code paths.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Kept the change to a single-line wording edit in `iter_091/01-task.md` to preserve smallest-task cadence.
- Recorded command evidence directly instead of broad validation to avoid unrelated churn.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Deferred additional historical wording harmonization to the next single-task iteration.
