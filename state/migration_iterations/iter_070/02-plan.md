# Plan

1. Confirm guidance from `state/migration_iterations/iter_069/06-next-iteration.md`.
2. Edit one line in `state/migration_iterations/iter_067/04-validation.md` command 1 to normalize snippet wording.
3. Run targeted validation commands (`rg` + `git --no-pager show`) for the edited surface.
4. Write iteration artifacts under `state/migration_iterations/iter_070/`.
