# Iteration summary

Completed seed iteration `iter_001` as a planning-only task.
Captured why the task is first and set acceptance criteria centered on features, tests, and eval alignment.
Produced a concrete execution plan naming the primary harness files and verification surfaces.
Documented execution and validation evidence for artifact completeness.
Recorded risks and explicit trade-offs, deferring implementation by design.
Defined one next task for `iter_002` with bounded scope and concrete acceptance criteria.
Left a clean handoff in `06-next-iteration.md` for incremental implementation.
