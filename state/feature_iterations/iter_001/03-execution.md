# Execution

## Commands/tools run

1. Read guidance:
   - `view .github/instructions/copilot-sdk-python.instructions.md`
   - `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
   - `view AGENTS.md`
   - `view DEVELOPMENT.md`
2. Iteration discovery:
   - searched `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (none found)
3. Implementation:
   - created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`
   - wrote iteration artifacts `01-task.md` through `07-summary.md`

## Files changed

- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`

- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale

This iteration intentionally performs planning only, per the seed requirement, and establishes an actionable backlog connecting harness features, deterministic tests, and eval regression gates.
