# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines this as the seed iteration objective.
- A concrete plan is required before implementation iterations can make minimal, verifiable changes.

## Acceptance criteria
- Provide a concise plan covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
- Map planned work to concrete files in `state/` and `evals/`.
- Define one next implementation task with explicit, testable criteria.
