# Summary

Implemented one bounded hardening task from the prior iteration backlog.
Added a new smoke mode that checks duplicate-count coverage-guard wrappers call the shared helper with exactly two positional arguments and no keyword arguments.
Registered the mode in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` with deterministic description text.
Executed the targeted smoke command and captured PASS evidence.
Produced all seven required iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_102/`.
No unrelated refactors were made.
