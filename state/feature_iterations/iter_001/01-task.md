# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines this as the seed iteration.
- A written plan is needed before implementation iterations touch harness runtime behavior.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise improvement plan that covers:
  - feature-level harness improvements in `state/`.
  - targeted tests validating those improvements.
  - eval/regression checks tied to `evals/*.yaml`, `state/metrics.json`, and iteration evidence.
- Keep scope to planning only (no runtime code edits).
