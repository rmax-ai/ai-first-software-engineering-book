# Plan

1. Apply minimal markdown-only replacements in `iter_018` and `iter_019` `03-execution.md`/`04-validation.md` command snippets.
2. Run targeted searches to confirm no remaining bare smoke-test `python` snippets in the touched files.
3. Capture commit-scoped evidence and write all iteration artifacts.
