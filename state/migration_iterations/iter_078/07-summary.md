# Summary

Iteration 078 executed one handed-off migration cleanup task.
The task was sourced directly from `state/migration_iterations/iter_077/06-next-iteration.md`.
A single acceptance-criteria line in `state/migration_iterations/iter_076/01-task.md` was normalized from escaped bare `python` wording to escaped `uv run python` wording.
No runtime code or public interface behavior changed.
Focused `rg` checks and scoped git evidence validated the exact change.
The target file update was committed as its own batch for traceability.
All seven required iteration artifacts were created under `state/migration_iterations/iter_078/`.
The next handoff continues the same narrow normalization stream at `iter_077/01-task.md`.
