# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- Read prompt contract: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read harness guidance: `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Inspected current harness surfaces:
  - `state/kernel.py`
  - `state/role_io_templates.py`
  - `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`
- Listed eval contracts: `evals/*.yaml`
- Created iteration artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- Established the required seed backlog before implementation work.
- Kept scope to one task (planning) with minimal, documentation-only diffs.
