# Execution

## Commands and tools run
- Read prompt and governance context:
  - `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
  - `view AGENTS.md`
  - `view DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Checked workspace state:
  - `git --no-pager status --short`
- Created iteration folder:
  - `mkdir -p state/feature_iterations/iter_001`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- This seed iteration is planning-only by contract, so output is the seven required markdown artifacts with concrete feature/test/eval direction.
