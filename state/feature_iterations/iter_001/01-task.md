# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `state/feature_iterations/` has no prior iterations, so the seed iteration must establish a concrete backlog.
- A clear first-pass plan reduces risk before touching harness execution code.

## Acceptance criteria
- Document concise feature improvements for the `state/` harness.
- Define targeted tests that prove each improvement.
- Define eval/regression checks tied to `evals/*.yaml` and metrics signals.
