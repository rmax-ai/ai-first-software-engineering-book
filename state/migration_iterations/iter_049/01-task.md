# Task

## Selected task title
Backfill recent migration iteration artifacts to use `uv run python` command snippets.

## Why this task now
The previous iteration recommended cleaning recent historical docs so outdated bare `python` snippets are not copied into new work.

## Acceptance criteria for this iteration
- Update recent `03-execution.md` and `04-validation.md` snippets from `python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py ...` to `uv run python ...`.
- Keep non-command narrative unchanged.
- Spot-check at least one updated file for correctness.
