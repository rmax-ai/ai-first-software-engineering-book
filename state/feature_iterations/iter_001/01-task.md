# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as planning-only.
- A written backlog is required before implementation iterations can proceed deterministically.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise improvement plan covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
- The plan explicitly maps future work to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- No harness implementation code is changed in this iteration.
