# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior feature iteration exists, and `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines this seed iteration as a planning pass that establishes the implementation backlog for future iterations.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise harness-improvement plan covering features, tests, and eval alignment.
- Identify concrete follow-on implementation slices tied to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Keep scope to planning only; no harness behavior changes in this iteration.
