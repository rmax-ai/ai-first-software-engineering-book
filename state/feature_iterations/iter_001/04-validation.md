# Validation

## Verification performed
1. Reviewed `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` to confirm required seven-artifact contract and seed planning constraints.
2. Reviewed `DEVELOPMENT.md` to align plan scope with UV workflows, harness files, and eval contracts.
3. Verified no previous feature iteration exists before creating `iter_001`.

## Observed results
- Iteration folder numbering starts at `iter_001` and all required markdown artifact paths are present.
- Plan content includes explicit coverage of features, tests, and eval regression detection.
- Next task recommendation is singular and actionable.

## Acceptance criteria status
- Feature planning coverage: **PASS**
- Test planning coverage: **PASS**
- Eval planning coverage: **PASS**
- Iteration folder contract completeness: **PASS**
