# Iteration summary

- Created seed iteration folder `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` with the full seven-artifact contract.
- Selected and completed a planning-only task: custom harness improvement planning.
- Documented why planning is first and defined measurable acceptance criteria.
- Produced a concrete phased plan spanning features, tests, and eval/regression checks.
- Anchored future implementation scope to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Captured validation approach and confirmed no unsupported test-pass claims.
- Logged risks, decisions, and deliberate deferrals to keep this iteration minimal.
- Defined one precise next task focused on deterministic trace-summary observability.
