# Summary

This iteration completed one backlog task from `iter_146` guidance.
A new exact-once smoke runner was added for the newest long-form adjacency-order guard mode.
`TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` now includes one additional mode entry wired to the new runner.
Targeted validation passed using the newly registered mode.
Scope remained minimal: one code file plus required iteration artifacts.
A single next task was documented to extend sequencing coverage.
