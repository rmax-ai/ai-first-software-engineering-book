# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- Read prompt contract: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read harness guidance: `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Checked prior iterations: `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (none found)
- Created this iteration artifact set under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- This is the seed iteration requested by the prompt and is intentionally planning-only.
- The artifacts provide actionable feature/test/eval guidance for the next implementation iteration.
