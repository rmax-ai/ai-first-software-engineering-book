# Plan

1. Inspect harness guidance in `DEVELOPMENT.md` and align scope with deterministic/uv workflows.
2. Define a feature backlog for:
   - richer execution traces and guardrail telemetry in `state/kernel.py`
   - clearer role contract templates in `state/role_io_templates.py`
   - broader deterministic smoke coverage in `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`
   - eval contract alignment in `evals/chapter-quality.yaml`, `evals/style-guard.yaml`, and `evals/drift-detection.yaml`
3. Convert backlog into ordered follow-up tasks with acceptance criteria and explicit validation commands.
