# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- Read prompt contract: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read harness guidance: `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Inspected existing feature iterations: `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (none present)

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
Created the seed planning iteration required by the execution prompt, with no runtime harness code edits.
