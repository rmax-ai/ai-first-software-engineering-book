# Task

## Selected task title
Add an adjacency-order smoke guard mode for the newest uniqueness-adjacency guard pairing.

## Why this task now
`state/feature_iterations/iter_127/06-next-iteration.md` prioritized ordering coverage so the newest `...order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-guard` mode remains immediately before the nearest prior `...order-uniqueness-adjacency-guard` mode.

## Acceptance criteria
1. Add one smoke mode function in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` that compares indices of the newest `...order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-guard` mode and prior `...order-uniqueness-adjacency-guard` mode, asserting immediate adjacency.
2. Register that new adjacency-order guard mode in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` with deterministic wording.
3. Run `uv run python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py --mode usage-examples-duplicate-count-wrapper-helper-uniqueness-order-adjacency-order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-order-guard` and capture PASS output.
