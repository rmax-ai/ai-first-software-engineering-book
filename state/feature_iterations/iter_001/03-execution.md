# Execution

## Commands / tools run
- Read prompt and governance sources:
  - `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
  - `view DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Discovered iteration set:
  - `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (no prior iterations found)
- Created iteration folder:
  - `mkdir -p state/feature_iterations/iter_001`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`

## Rationale per change
- `01-task.md`: captured the single selected seed task and acceptance criteria.
- `02-plan.md`: defined a concrete, file-targeted backlog covering features/tests/evals.
- `03-execution.md`: documented evidence of discovery and artifact creation steps.
