# Summary

This iteration executed the iter_080 recommended next task.
Exactly two additional duplicate-count coverage-guard wrappers were migrated to `_run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard(...)`.
Wrapper-specific PASS output strings were kept unchanged.
Both required smoke modes passed:
- `usage-examples-duplicate-count-mode-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard`
- `usage-examples-duplicate-count-mode-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard`
The iter_081 artifacts document execution evidence, validation results, decisions, and one scoped next task for iter_082.
