# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Very low risk: this iteration only edits historical markdown command wording.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Followed the prior handoff exactly and limited the task to one line to keep scope minimal.
- Committed the content change separately before writing artifacts to satisfy auto-commit guidance while preserving clear history.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Deferred broader cleanup of older historical wording outside this handed-off task.
