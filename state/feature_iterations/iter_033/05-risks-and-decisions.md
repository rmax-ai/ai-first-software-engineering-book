# Risks and decisions

## Risks discovered
- Long chained guard mode names are easy to mis-target by one suffix segment.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Applied a one-line target-name fix instead of broader helper refactoring to keep this iteration narrowly scoped.

## Deferred intentionally
- Did not refactor repetitive guard handlers; left for future iterations if specifically requested.
