# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
The feature-iteration track has no prior entries, so the seed iteration must establish a concrete backlog for the custom harness in `state/` before implementation work begins.

## Acceptance criteria
- A planning narrative defines harness improvements across features, tests, and eval coverage.
- The plan names how future iterations will address `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Validation evidence confirms the planning artifacts are complete and aligned with `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
