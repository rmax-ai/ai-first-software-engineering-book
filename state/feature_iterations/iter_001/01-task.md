# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior feature iteration exists, and `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as a planning-only pass for harness improvements under `state/`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Provide a concrete improvement plan covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
- Describe follow-on implementation work for `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Keep this iteration planning-only (no runtime behavior changes).
