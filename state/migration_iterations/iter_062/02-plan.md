# Plan

1. Update one line in `state/migration_iterations/iter_046/06-next-iteration.md` to normalize the import-check command snippet.
2. Run targeted validation (`rg` + file-specific `git diff/show`) for the changed file.
3. Record evidence and decisions in the iteration artifacts.

- `state/migration_iterations/iter_046/06-next-iteration.md`
