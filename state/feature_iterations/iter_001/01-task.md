# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- This is the seed feature iteration required by `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.
- A concrete backlog is needed before implementing harness changes in `state/`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise backlog plan covering **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations** for the harness.
- Explicitly map future work to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Provide one clear next implementation task in `06-next-iteration.md`.
