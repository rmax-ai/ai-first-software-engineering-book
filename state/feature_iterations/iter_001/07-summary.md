# Iteration Summary
- Completed one planning-only task: "Plan custom state harness improvements."
- Established acceptance criteria spanning features, tests, and eval mapping.
- Produced a concrete execution plan centered on `state/kernel.py`, role IO scaffolds, smoke checks, and eval contracts.
- Captured execution evidence and decisions in the required artifact set.
- Deferred implementation intentionally to keep iteration one scoped and low risk.
- Recommended a single next task: deterministic trace logging scaffolds with smoke validation.
