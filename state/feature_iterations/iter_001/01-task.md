# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now

No prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_XXX` artifacts exist, so the first iteration should establish a concrete, reviewable backlog for improving the custom harness in `state/`.

## Acceptance criteria

- Define a concise improvement story that covers required harness **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
- Scope later implementation work to concrete files, including `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and relevant `evals/*.yaml`.
- Produce a single recommended next task with actionable acceptance criteria.
