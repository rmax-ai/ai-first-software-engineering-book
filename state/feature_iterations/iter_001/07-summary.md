# Iteration Summary

This iteration created the first feature-improvement artifact set at `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
The selected task was planning-only: define a practical harness-improvement backlog before code changes.
The backlog now explicitly covers feature work in `state/kernel.py` and `state/role_io_templates.py`.
It also defines verification expansion in `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`.
Evaluation alignment needs were scoped to `evals/*.yaml` and `state/metrics.json`.
Validation confirmed all seven required files exist and the diff is documentation-only.
No runtime harness behavior was modified in this iteration.
A single concrete next task was recorded: implement deterministic trace-summary diagnostics.
