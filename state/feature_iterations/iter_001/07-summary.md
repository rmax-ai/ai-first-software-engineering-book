# Iteration summary

This seed iteration completed the planning-only backlog setup required by the incremental execution prompt.
A new `iter_001` folder was created under `state/feature_iterations/` with all seven required artifacts.
The task selected was planning custom state harness improvements rather than implementing code changes.
The plan covers feature work in kernel/role-IO scaffolds, testing via UV smoke and targeted unit tests, and eval/regression alignment.
Risks were documented around trace schema stability and smoke-test brittleness.
A single next task was defined: implement deterministic kernel trace-summary observability and validate via smoke assertions.
The handoff is concise and ready for the next autonomous iteration.
