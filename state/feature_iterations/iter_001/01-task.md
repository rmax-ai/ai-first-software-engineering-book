# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- No prior feature-iteration backlog exists under `state/feature_iterations/`.
- A clear plan is needed before touching harness execution paths.
- This creates a deterministic handoff for implementation iterations.

## Acceptance criteria
- Document concise feature improvements for the custom harness in `state/`.
- Document targeted tests that will verify each proposed improvement.
- Document eval/regression checks tied to `evals/*.yaml` and harness outputs.
- Keep this iteration planning-only (no implementation changes in runtime code).
