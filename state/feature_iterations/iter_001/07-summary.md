# Summary

This seed feature iteration established the custom harness improvement backlog without implementing code changes.
It selected and documented the story "Plan custom state harness improvements" as required.
The plan now covers three dimensions explicitly: new harness features, targeted tests, and eval/regression detection paths.
Future work is sequenced around deterministic trace-summary observability in `state/kernel.py`.
Validation confirmed the full seven-file artifact contract and prompt alignment.
Risks and deferrals were documented to keep implementation steps bounded and verifiable.
The repository is now prepared for execution-oriented feature iterations beginning with `iter_002`.
