# Plan

1. Edit `state/migration_iterations/iter_091/01-task.md` line 10 to normalize the evidence wording while leaving the command text intact.
2. Run focused validation commands (`rg` checks and `git --no-pager diff`) for the changed file.
3. Record execution, validation outcomes, risks, and the next single task recommendation.
