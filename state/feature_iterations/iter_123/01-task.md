# Task

## Selected task title
Add uniqueness smoke guard for the newest adjacency mode registration.

## Why this task now
`iter_122/06-next-iteration.md` selected this as the smallest unfinished deterministic hardening step after adding the newest adjacency mode.

## Acceptance criteria for this iteration
1. Add one smoke mode in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` that asserts `usage-examples-duplicate-count-wrapper-helper-uniqueness-order-adjacency-order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-guard` appears exactly once in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS`.
2. Register the new smoke mode in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` with deterministic wording.
3. Run the targeted smoke command for the new mode and capture PASS output.
