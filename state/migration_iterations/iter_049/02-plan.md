# Plan

1. Identify recent iteration `03-execution.md` and `04-validation.md` files that still use bare `python` smoke-test snippets.
2. Apply minimal markdown-only edits to replace those snippets with `uv run python`.
3. Verify edits with diff and targeted search/spot-check.
4. Record execution, validation, risks, and next task in this iteration artifact set.
