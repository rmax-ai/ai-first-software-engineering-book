# Summary

Created iteration `iter_089` and executed one scoped migration task from prior guidance.
The task normalized legacy fallback-error snippet wording in `state/migration_iterations/iter_083/06-next-iteration.md`.
A targeted one-line edit replaced `python ...` wording with `uv run python ...`.
Validation recorded both pre-change and post-change `rg` checks against the exact target line.
Scoped `git --no-pager diff` confirmed only one line changed in the historical artifact.
All seven required `iter_089` handoff artifacts were added.
No runtime code, interfaces, or behavior were modified.
One concrete next task was documented for continued incremental cleanup.
