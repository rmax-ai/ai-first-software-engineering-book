# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- Read prompt contract: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read governance/development guidance: `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- Checked existing iteration folders: `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (none found)
- Created iteration folder: `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- This seed iteration is planning-only by prompt design, so changes are limited to artifact documentation.
- The backlog explicitly targets harness surfaces and verification paths required for safe follow-up implementation iterations.
