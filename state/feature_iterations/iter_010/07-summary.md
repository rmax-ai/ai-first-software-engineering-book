# Summary

Executed one unfinished backlog task from `iter_009` by adding deterministic empty-history guard coverage.
Added `trace-summary-empty-history-guard` to `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
Wired the mode through usage docs, CLI choices, help text, and mode dispatch.
Validated the new mode and two adjacent guard modes.
Verified syntax with `py_compile`.
Captured full iteration artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_010/`.
All acceptance criteria for this iteration were met with a minimal, targeted diff.
