# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- Read `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` for iteration contract.
- Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` for harness development constraints.
- Enumerated `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (none found), selected `iter_001`.
- Created folder `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
- Authored iteration artifacts `01-task.md` through `07-summary.md`.

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- This iteration is planning-only by prompt contract, so all changes are documentation artifacts that define actionable next steps.
