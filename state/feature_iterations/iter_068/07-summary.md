# Summary

Implemented one deterministic smoke enhancement by adding `trace-summary-fixture-root-cleanup-parity`.
The new mode runs both existing root-cleanup guards (kernel and non-kernel) in one command, preserving existing standalone modes.
Targeted validation passed for the new mode and for mode/doc coverage guards.
Iteration artifacts were created under `state/feature_iterations/iter_068/` following the seven-file contract.
Next iteration is scoped to parity coverage for fixture-cleanup (non-root) modes.
