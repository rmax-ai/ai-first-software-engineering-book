# Summary

Completed iteration 117 by executing one backlog task from `iter_116/06-next-iteration.md`.
Added a new smoke mode that asserts `...-uniqueness-guard` remains immediately before `usage-examples-mode-set-coverage-guard`.
Registered the new mode in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` with deterministic wording and no public interface changes.
Ran the targeted smoke command for the new mode and received the expected PASS output with exit code 0.
Captured all required iteration artifacts (`01` through `07`) under `state/feature_iterations/iter_117/`.
Recommended a single next task to add uniqueness protection for the newly added adjacency mode.
