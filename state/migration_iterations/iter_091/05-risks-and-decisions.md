# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Similar residual acceptance-criteria wording may remain in nearby historical iteration artifacts.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Applied only a one-line wording edit to preserve reviewability and avoid changing command text.
- Kept this iteration scoped to one unfinished cleanup task per the execution contract.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Additional wording alignment in other prior iteration artifacts is deferred to the next iteration.
