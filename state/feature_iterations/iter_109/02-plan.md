# Plan

1. Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` and the previous handoff in `state/feature_iterations/iter_108/06-next-iteration.md`.
2. Add a focused uniqueness-count guard mode function in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
3. Register the mode in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` with deterministic wording.
4. Run the targeted smoke command for the new mode.
5. Record execution, validation, risks, next task, and summary in `state/feature_iterations/iter_109/0*.md`.
