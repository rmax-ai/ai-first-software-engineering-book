# Summary

Completed one bounded backlog task from the prior iteration handoff.
Added `usage-examples-duplicate-count-wrapper-helper-uniqueness-order-adjacency-order-guard` to assert immediate ordering from uniqueness-order guard to uniqueness-order-adjacency guard in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS`.
Registered the new mode with deterministic description text.
Executed the targeted smoke mode and captured a PASS result.
Produced all seven iteration artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_108/`.
Kept scope minimal with no unrelated refactors.
