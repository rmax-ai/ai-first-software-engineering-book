# Plan

1. Convert exactly two wrappers in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` to delegate to `_run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard(...)`.
2. Touch only:
   - `run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_mode`
   - `run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_mode`
3. Keep each wrapper's PASS line text identical by passing unchanged strings into helper arguments.
4. Run the two required smoke modes from acceptance criteria.
5. Record execution details, validation evidence, risks/decisions, one next task, and summary in iter_083 artifacts.
