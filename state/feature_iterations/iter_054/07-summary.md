# Summary

This iteration executed one task: planning custom harness improvements.
It created the full seven-artifact handoff in `state/feature_iterations/iter_054/`.
The plan defines concrete feature tracks across observability, role I/O scaffolds, and deterministic controls.
It also maps validation expectations to targeted smoke/unit checks and eval contracts in `evals/`.
No harness code was changed in this iteration by design.
Validation confirmed artifact completeness and alignment with `execute.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
The next iteration is narrowed to a single implementation step: structured phase-level trace logging in `state/kernel.py` with smoke coverage updates.
