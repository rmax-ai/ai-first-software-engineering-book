# Summary

Created `iter_057` and completed one smallest unfinished migration handoff task.
The task was inherited from `iter_056/06-next-iteration.md` and targeted a single command snippet in `iter_021/06-next-iteration.md`.
A one-line edit replaced bare `python` with `uv run python` for the fallback-error smoke mode command.
Targeted validation confirmed the new snippet exists and the old snippet no longer appears.
Diff evidence showed only the intended line changed in the historical handoff file.
All seven required iteration artifacts were written under `state/migration_iterations/iter_057/`.
Risk remained low by avoiding any unrelated refactors or broad rewrites.
A single next-step recommendation was provided for another adjacent one-file normalization.
