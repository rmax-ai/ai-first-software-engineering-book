# Summary

This iteration completed one backlog task from `state/feature_iterations/iter_136/06-next-iteration.md`.
It added uniqueness-count smoke coverage for the newest long-form `...uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-guard` mode.
`state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` now includes a new `...-uniqueness-guard` runner that enforces exactly one registration of that newest mode.
`TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` now registers a matching runnable smoke mode for that assertion.
Targeted validation ran with `uv run python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py --mode <new-mode>` and returned PASS.
All required iteration artifacts were created in `state/feature_iterations/iter_137/`.
The diff stayed scoped to one code file plus iteration handoff documentation.
