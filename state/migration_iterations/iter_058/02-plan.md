# Plan

1. Confirm `iter_057` handoff and inspect `state/migration_iterations/iter_046/01-task.md`.
2. Apply a one-line markdown edit to switch the live smoke command to `uv run python`.
3. Run focused validation commands to confirm the normalized snippet exists and capture file-specific diff/show evidence.
4. Record execution, validation, risks, and handoff in the required iteration artifacts.
