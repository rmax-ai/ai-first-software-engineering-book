# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
The feature-iteration pipeline has no prior planning artifact, so a seed backlog is required before implementing harness changes safely. A concrete plan reduces drift and ensures later iterations target measurable improvements in `state/` and `evals/`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Defines a concise plan that covers feature, test, and evaluation improvements for the harness.
- Includes explicit future touchpoints for `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Leaves exactly one recommended next task with concrete acceptance criteria.
