# Execution log

## Commands and tools used
- Read prompt contract: `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read harness guidance: `view DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Checked prior iterations: `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (none found)
- Created iteration artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`

- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
This seed iteration is intentionally planning-only, per prompt requirements, to establish a concrete and testable backlog before modifying harness code.
