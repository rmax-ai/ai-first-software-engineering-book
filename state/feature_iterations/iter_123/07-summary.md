# Summary

This iteration executed one backlog item from `iter_122/06-next-iteration.md`.
A new smoke mode was added to assert the newest adjacency guard mode appears exactly once in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS`.
The mode was registered with deterministic description text and no public interfaces changed.
Targeted verification was run for the new mode and its result is captured in validation artifacts.
All seven required markdown artifacts were written under `state/feature_iterations/iter_123/`.
The next iteration recommends adjacency-order hardening between the two newest uniqueness guard modes.
