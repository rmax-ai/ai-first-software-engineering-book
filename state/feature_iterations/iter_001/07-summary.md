- Created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` as the seed feature-improvement iteration.
- Selected and completed one planning-only task: custom harness improvement plan definition.
- Documented acceptance criteria centered on feature, test, and eval planning coverage.
- Produced a future-facing implementation plan spanning kernel, role templates, smoke checks, and eval YAMLs.
- Recorded execution evidence and validation checks for artifact completeness and scope compliance.
- Captured risks and explicit deferrals to avoid unplanned code churn in a planning iteration.
- Recommended exactly one next task with measurable checks and concrete file touchpoints.
