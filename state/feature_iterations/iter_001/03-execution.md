## Commands/tools run
- `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`

- `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (no prior iterations found)
- `mkdir -p state/feature_iterations/iter_001`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`

- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- Created the seed iteration as planning-only, as required by the prompt.
- Focused content on concrete harness feature/test/eval backlog items for later execution iterations.
