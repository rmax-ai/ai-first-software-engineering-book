# Plan

1. Open `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` near the latest uniqueness/adjacency duplicate-count guards.
2. Add one new guard function that counts occurrences of the newest `...order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-guard` mode and asserts count equals 1.
3. Register a new mode tuple ending with `...order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-guard` in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS`.
4. Run targeted smoke validation for only the new mode.
5. Document execution, validation, risks, and next task in `state/feature_iterations/iter_135/*.md`.
