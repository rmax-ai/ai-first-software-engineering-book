# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Similar historical escaped command snippets may still exist in older iteration artifacts outside this single-task scope.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Per runner rules, only the one highest-priority task from `iter_084/06-next-iteration.md` was executed.
- Committed immediately after the meaningful one-line change to satisfy auto-commit instruction.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Broader cleanup of legacy escaped command snippets in other historical iteration artifacts.
