# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
The feature-improvement track starts with a seed iteration that defines a concrete, testable backlog for upgrading the custom harness in `state/`. Establishing this plan first keeps later implementation iterations focused, measurable, and aligned with `DEVELOPMENT.md` guidance.

## Acceptance criteria
- Provide a concise harness-improvement plan covering features, tests, and eval/regression detection.
- Name concrete future touchpoints: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Leave exactly one next recommended task with explicit acceptance criteria.
