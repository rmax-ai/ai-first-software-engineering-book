# Plan

1. Inspect prior-iteration guidance and the target validation file.
2. Apply a one-line edit to normalize snippet wording in command 1.
3. Run targeted `rg` checks and `git --no-pager diff` for verification evidence.
4. Record execution, validation, risks, next task, and summary in iteration artifacts.
