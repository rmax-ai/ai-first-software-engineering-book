# Iteration Summary

This seed iteration completed a planning-only backlog setup for custom harness improvements.  
`iter_001` was selected as the next index after confirming no prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_XXX` folders.  
The task artifact defines acceptance criteria centered on features, tests, and eval alignment.  
The plan artifact maps future implementation work to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.  
Execution and validation artifacts document discovery steps and pass/fail checks for this planning deliverable.  
Risk notes capture potential coupling and eval brittleness concerns.  
A single next task is recommended: implement deterministic trace-summary enrichment in kernel + smoke coverage.  
No harness runtime code was changed in this iteration; scope was intentionally constrained to planning documentation.
