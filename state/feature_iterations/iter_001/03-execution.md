# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- Read guidance with `view`:
  - `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Checked iteration baseline with `glob` on `state/feature_iterations/iter_*`.
- Created the iteration artifact files in `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale per change
- Added task definition to scope this seed iteration as planning only.
- Added implementation-ready plan spanning harness features, tests, and eval linkage.
- Added execution/validation/risk/next/summary handoff docs required by the iteration contract.
