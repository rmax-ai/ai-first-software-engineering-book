# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
The feature-iteration backlog is empty, so the first iteration should establish a concrete improvement roadmap for the `state/` harness with explicit scope for features, tests, and eval alignment.

## Acceptance criteria
- A concise plan exists for harness feature improvements with clear behaviors/controls to add.
- The plan lists targeted validation work (smoke/tests) tied to specific files.
- The plan maps expected regression detection to existing eval assets under `evals/` and harness metrics.
