# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- No prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_XXX` backlog exists, so this seed iteration establishes the execution roadmap.
- A written, testable plan is required before touching harness internals (`state/kernel.py`, role scaffolds, smoke/eval surfaces).

## Acceptance criteria
1. The plan identifies concrete harness feature improvements for observability, deterministic controls, and role I/O scaffolding.
2. The plan names targeted tests/verification commands for each planned change area.
3. The plan maps expected evaluation impact to existing eval contracts under `evals/`.
4. All seven required iteration artifacts are present and internally consistent.
