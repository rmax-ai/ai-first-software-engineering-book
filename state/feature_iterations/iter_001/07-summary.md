# Iteration summary

This seed iteration created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` and completed the seven required artifacts.
The task intentionally focused on planning the custom harness improvements instead of implementation.
The plan covers feature work for deterministic kernel observability and role-IO scaffolding.
The plan defines targeted verification commands, including smoke and kernel execution paths.
The plan maps regression detection to `evals/chapter-quality.yaml`, `evals/style-guard.yaml`, and `evals/drift-detection.yaml`.
Risks and trade-offs were documented with explicit deferrals.
A single concrete next task was selected to keep iteration 002 small and testable.
The repository is now prepared for incremental implementation with clear acceptance criteria.
