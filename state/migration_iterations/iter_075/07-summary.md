# Summary

Iteration 075 completed one minimal migration artifact cleanup task.
The accepted target was `state/migration_iterations/iter_071/01-task.md` because the previous handoff target was already complete.
A single acceptance-criteria line was normalized from bare `python` snippet wording to `uv run python` wording.
No code paths or runtime behavior were changed.
Focused `rg` checks and a scoped git diff validated the update.
All seven required iteration artifacts were created under `state/migration_iterations/iter_075/`.
The next iteration recommendation continues this same narrow normalization stream.
