# Execution log

## Commands/tools run
- Read `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` to follow iteration contract.
- Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` for harness development constraints.
- Enumerated existing feature iterations (none found), so created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
- Authored seven required markdown artifacts for this planning iteration.

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- Seed the feature backlog with a planning-only iteration so future work can execute one smallest implementation task at a time.
