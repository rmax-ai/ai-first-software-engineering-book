# Iteration summary

This seed feature-improvement iteration established the initial backlog for custom harness enhancements.
It selected a planning-only task and documented clear acceptance criteria for features, tests, and eval mapping.
The plan targets `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and relevant eval YAML contracts.
Validation confirmed all seven required artifacts exist and that scope remained documentation-only.
Risks and trade-offs were captured to reduce surprise during implementation iterations.
The next iteration is explicitly narrowed to deterministic trace-summary hardening with smoke-test enforcement.
