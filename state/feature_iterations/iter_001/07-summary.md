# Iteration summary

This seed iteration completed one task: planning custom harness improvements in `state/`.
All seven required markdown artifacts were created in `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
The plan covers features (kernel observability and role I/O structure), tests (deterministic UV smoke and targeted checks), and evals (regression guards in `evals/*.yaml`).
No production code was changed; scope was intentionally planning-only.
Validation confirmed required target files exist and that the plan aligns with `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
The next iteration is narrowly scoped to implementing deterministic outcome tagging in `state/kernel.py`.
