# Iteration summary

This iteration established the first `state/feature_iterations/iter_001` backlog entry.
It selected a single planning task focused on custom harness improvements.
The plan explicitly covers feature work for deterministic controls and observability.
It also defines test strategy centered on UV smoke validation and targeted harness checks.
Eval regression coverage is tied to `evals/chapter-quality.yaml`, `evals/style-guard.yaml`, and `evals/drift-detection.yaml`.
Execution and validation artifacts capture discovery, created files, and acceptance checks.
No harness runtime code was modified in this seed planning iteration.
One concrete next task was provided for implementation in `iter_002`.
