# Summary

Created iteration `iter_092` and completed one scoped migration-artifact wording cleanup.
The task updated residual acceptance-criteria evidence wording in `state/migration_iterations/iter_090/01-task.md`.
A one-line edit changed trailing text to `confirms the normalized snippet mention`.
Targeted validation confirmed command text stayed unchanged and the updated wording is present.
Scoped diff evidence showed only the intended single-line modification.
All seven required `iter_092` handoff artifacts were added.
No runtime code, interfaces, or behavior were modified.
A single concrete next cleanup task was documented for `iter_093`.
