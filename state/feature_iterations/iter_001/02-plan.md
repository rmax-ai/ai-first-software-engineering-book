# Iteration plan

1. Review `DEVELOPMENT.md` and this runner contract to align with UV workflow and harness governance.
2. Define feature backlog items for deterministic controls, trace observability, and role I/O scaffold clarity.
3. Define targeted verification for each backlog item using smoke paths like `uv run python state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py` plus focused kernel tests.
4. Map eval impact to existing guardrails under `evals/chapter-quality.yaml`, `evals/style-guard.yaml`, and `evals/drift-detection.yaml`.
5. Write seven required artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` and recommend exactly one next task.
