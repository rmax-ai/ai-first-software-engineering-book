# Validation

## Verification actions
1. Reviewed iteration requirements in `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.
2. Cross-checked harness conventions in `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
3. Verified artifact contract completion for `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md` through `07-summary.md`.

## Observed results
- Seed iteration is planning-only and does not require runtime test execution.
- Plan content explicitly includes features/tests/evals and names future target files.
- All seven required markdown artifacts are present.

## Acceptance criteria status
- AC1 (features/tests/evals coverage): **Pass**
- AC2 (future touch points listed): **Pass**
- AC3 (complete actionable artifact set): **Pass**
