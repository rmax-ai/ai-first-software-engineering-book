# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as a planning iteration.
- A concrete backlog is required before implementing changes to `state/kernel.py`, templates, smoke tests, and eval contracts.

## Acceptance criteria
1. Produce a concise implementation backlog that explicitly covers features, tests, and evals for the custom harness.
2. Reference concrete target files: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and relevant `evals/*.yaml`.
3. Provide one clear next iteration task with measurable acceptance criteria.
