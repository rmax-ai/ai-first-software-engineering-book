# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the first iteration as a planning pass.
- No prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_XXX` folder exists, so this is the required seed iteration.
- A concrete backlog is needed before code changes to `state/` and `evals/`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan that explicitly covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
- Anchor the plan to concrete files: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Deliver all seven iteration artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
