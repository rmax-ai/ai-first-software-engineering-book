# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- No implementation changes were made yet, so planned improvements remain unproven until follow-up execution iterations run.
- Eval contract mapping may require refinement once concrete kernel/smoke changes are drafted.

## Decisions and trade-offs
- Chose the required seed planning scope from `execute.md` instead of speculative code edits.
- Kept the backlog concise and file-specific to preserve one-task-per-iteration discipline.

## Intentionally deferred
- Any direct edits to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
