# Iteration summary

This iteration executed the required seed planning task for custom harness improvements.
It created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` and produced all seven contract artifacts.
The plan defines follow-up work across harness features, targeted tests, and eval regression checks.
Key future touchpoints are `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
Validation confirms all required markdown artifacts exist and acceptance criteria for this planning iteration are met.
No runtime harness behavior was changed in this iteration.
A single concrete next task is provided to begin implementation in iter_002.
