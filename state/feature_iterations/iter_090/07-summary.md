# Summary

This iteration completed one bounded duplicate-count coverage-guard deduplication task.
Two additional wrapper functions were migrated to `_run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard(...)`.
The migrated wrappers correspond to the 21-guard and 22-guard variants.
Wrapper names, mode names, and PASS strings were preserved.
Both required smoke commands were executed and passed.
All seven required iteration artifacts were created under `state/feature_iterations/iter_090/`.
The next iteration continues the same two-wrapper migration cadence.
