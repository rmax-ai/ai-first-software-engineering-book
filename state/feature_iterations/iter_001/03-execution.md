# Execution log

## Commands/tools run
- Read guidance: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read harness rules/context: `AGENTS.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Checked iteration baseline: `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (none found)
- Created artifact folder/files under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
This seed iteration intentionally creates a planning-only backlog so later iterations can execute one smallest harness change at a time with explicit validation and eval mapping.
