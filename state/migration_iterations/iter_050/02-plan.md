# Plan

1. Identify the next unfinished contiguous historical batch with bare smoke-test `python` snippets.
2. Apply minimal markdown-only edits in the selected batch (`iter_024`-`iter_025`) for `03-execution.md` and `04-validation.md`.
3. Validate via targeted ripgrep and diff inspection.
4. Record outcomes and handoff in iteration artifacts.
