# Iteration Summary

This seed feature iteration established the first backlog contract at `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
The task was intentionally planning-only to match the prompt's seed requirement.
Artifacts define a concrete improvement roadmap for `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, and `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`.
The plan ties each feature track to explicit verification commands in the UV-managed runtime.
Evaluation alignment is documented against `evals/chapter-quality.yaml`, `evals/style-guard.yaml`, and `evals/drift-detection.yaml`.
Execution and validation logs record prompt compliance and folder-contract completion.
Risks and trade-offs were captured to prevent scope drift and preserve deterministic checks.
One next task is specified with bounded acceptance criteria and expected files for `iter_002`.
