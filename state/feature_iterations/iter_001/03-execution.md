# Execution Log

## Commands and tools run
- Read guidance:
  - `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
  - `view DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Discovered iteration baseline:
  - `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*`
- Authored iteration artifacts:
  - created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md` through `07-summary.md`.

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- Captured the required seed planning task in the seven-file iteration contract.
- Kept this iteration planning-only to satisfy prompt scope and avoid premature implementation.
