# Summary

Created `iter_064` and completed one focused migration cleanup task.
Ran targeted search to locate remaining bare-`python` snippets in iteration artifacts.
Updated `state/migration_iterations/iter_045/06-next-iteration.md` to use `uv run python`.
Kept the change minimal and limited to one highest-priority legacy command snippet.
Recorded targeted validation showing no remaining bare snippet in the updated file.
Wrote all seven required `iter_064` artifacts for task, plan, execution, validation, risks, next task, and summary.
Deferred broader normalization to subsequent single-task iterations.
