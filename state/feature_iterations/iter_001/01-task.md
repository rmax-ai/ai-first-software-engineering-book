# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines this seed iteration as a planning-first pass.
- A concrete backlog is required before editing `state/kernel.py` and related harness surfaces.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan that covers feature, test, and evaluation improvements for the custom harness.
- Explicitly map follow-up work to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Deliver exactly seven iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
