# Plan

1. Reuse `_run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard(...)` in exactly two additional wrappers in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
2. Limit edits to:
   - `run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_mode`
   - `run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_coverage_guard_mode`
3. Preserve existing PASS strings by passing unchanged wrapper-specific text into helper arguments.
4. Run the two required smoke modes from acceptance criteria.
5. Record execution, validation evidence, risks, one next task, and summary in iter_082 artifacts.
