# Summary

This iteration completed one backlog task from `state/feature_iterations/iter_139/06-next-iteration.md`.
It added adjacency-order smoke coverage for the newest long-form `...uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-guard` mode.
`state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` now includes a new `...-uniqueness-guard-adjacency-order-guard` runner that asserts newest/prior ordering for the long-form uniqueness modes.
`TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` now registers a runnable smoke mode for that new adjacency assertion.
Targeted validation passed with `uv run python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py --mode <new-mode>`.
All seven required iteration artifacts were created under `state/feature_iterations/iter_140/`.
The diff remained scoped to one code file plus the new iteration handoff markdown files.
