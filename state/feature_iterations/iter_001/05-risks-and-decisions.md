# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- The planning iteration does not execute harness code, so assumptions about implementation effort and test granularity still need confirmation during execution iterations.

## Decisions made
- Chose a planning-only iteration, as required by the seed instructions.
- Prioritized minimal, concrete backlog items over broad architectural rewrite proposals.

## Deferred items
- Implementation details and code-level trade-offs are deferred to subsequent iteration tasks.
