# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Many historical artifacts still mention bare `python` snippets in narrative/search examples, so normalization is still incomplete.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Prioritized the highest remaining direct legacy command snippet in `iter_045/06-next-iteration.md`.
- Kept scope to one file, per execute prompt constraints for a single smallest task.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Broader cleanup of lower-priority remaining legacy snippets across older iteration folders.
