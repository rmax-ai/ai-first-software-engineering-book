# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- Read `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.
- Read `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- Checked `state/feature_iterations/` to determine the next iteration (`iter_001`).
- Created iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- This seed iteration intentionally produces a planning backlog only, per prompt requirements.
