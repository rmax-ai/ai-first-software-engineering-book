# Summary

Created `iter_056` and executed one smallest unfinished migration handoff task.
The task was inherited from `iter_055/06-next-iteration.md` and targeted a single command snippet in `iter_022/01-task.md`.
A one-line edit replaced bare `python` with `uv run python` for fallback-error smoke mode.
Targeted verification confirmed the new snippet exists and the old snippet no longer appears.
Diff evidence showed only the intended line changed in the historical task file.
All seven required iteration artifacts were written under `state/migration_iterations/iter_056/`.
Risk was kept low by avoiding any unrelated refactors or broader file rewrites.
A single next-step recommendation was provided for another adjacent one-file normalization.
