# Summary

This iteration executed one backlog task from `state/feature_iterations/iter_113/06-next-iteration.md`.
A new uniqueness smoke guard now ensures the latest adjacency-order guard mode is registered exactly once.
`state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` gained `run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_wrapper_helper_uniqueness_order_adjacency_order_uniqueness_adjacency_uniqueness_adjacency_order_uniqueness_guard_mode`.
`TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` now includes `usage-examples-duplicate-count-wrapper-helper-uniqueness-order-adjacency-order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-order-uniqueness-guard` with deterministic description text.
Targeted validation ran with `uv run python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py --mode usage-examples-duplicate-count-wrapper-helper-uniqueness-order-adjacency-order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-order-uniqueness-guard`.
Validation output was PASS with exit code 0.
All seven required markdown artifacts were written to `state/feature_iterations/iter_114/`.
