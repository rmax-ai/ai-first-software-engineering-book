# Summary

Created `iter_059` and completed one smallest unfinished migration handoff task.
The task came directly from `iter_058/06-next-iteration.md` and targeted `iter_046/02-plan.md`.
A single line was updated to replace bare `python` with `uv run python` for the live smoke command snippet.
Focused validation confirmed the normalized snippet exists and the file diff is one-line only.
All seven required markdown artifacts were written under `state/migration_iterations/iter_059/`.
Risk stayed low by keeping scope to one documentation normalization and deferring broader cleanup.
The next iteration recommends one adjacent one-line normalization in `iter_046/07-summary.md`.
