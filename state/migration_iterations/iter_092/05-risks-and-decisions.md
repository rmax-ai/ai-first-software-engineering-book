# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Similar acceptance-criteria wording drift may still exist in adjacent historical iteration artifacts.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Applied only a one-line wording edit for minimal, reviewable scope.
- Kept command text unchanged to match inherited task guidance.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Further wording alignment outside this single-file cleanup is deferred to the next iteration.
