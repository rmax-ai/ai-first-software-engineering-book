# Execution

## Commands/tools run
1. Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `state/feature_iterations/iter_141/06-next-iteration.md`.
2. Edited `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` to add one adjacency-order runner and one mode registration.
3. Ran targeted validation command for the new mode.

## Files changed
- `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_142/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_142/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_142/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_142/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_142/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_142/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_142/07-summary.md`

## Short rationale per change
- Added deterministic adjacency-order coverage for the newest long-form uniqueness guard mode pair.
- Registered one dedicated smoke mode to keep verification targeted.
- Wrote the required seven iteration artifacts for clean handoff continuity.
