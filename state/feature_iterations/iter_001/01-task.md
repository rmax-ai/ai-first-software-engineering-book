# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
There are no prior feature iteration artifacts, so this seed iteration establishes a concrete, testable backlog for harness upgrades.

## Acceptance criteria
- Define concise feature improvements spanning `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, and harness observability controls.
- Define targeted tests, including `uv run python state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py` and focused harness checks.
- Define regression evaluations tied to `evals/*.yaml` and expected signals in `state/metrics.json`.
- Produce one next iteration task with concrete acceptance criteria and expected file touch points.
