# Task

## Selected task title
Validate kernel mock regression path with regenerated role outputs and confirm heading-gate unblock evidence.

## Why this task now
`iter_013` found the remaining blocker in mock regression. The smallest next step is to verify planner/writer/critic generation and heading preservation evidence in the existing mock path.

## Acceptance criteria for this iteration
- Execute migration-relevant mock regression checks for `01-paradigm-shift`.
- Confirm writer output preserves chapter heading structure.
- Capture concrete evidence that planner/writer/critic artifacts are produced.
