# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- Read: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read: `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Inspected iteration root: `state/feature_iterations/iter_*`
- Wrote iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- This seed iteration is explicitly planning-only and establishes a concrete, testable backlog for harness improvements before implementation.
