# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `state/feature_iterations/` has no prior iterations, so the seed iteration must establish a clear backlog.
- A written plan is required before touching kernel behavior to keep future diffs minimal and verifiable.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks**.
- Scope includes planned work for `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Define exactly one concrete next iteration task with measurable validation evidence.
