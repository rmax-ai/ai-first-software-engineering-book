# Plan
1. Inventory current harness touchpoints from `DEVELOPMENT.md` and repository structure to anchor scope.
2. Define feature backlog items for:
   - `state/kernel.py` traceability and deterministic controls.
   - `state/role_io_templates.py` scaffold clarity and contract checks.
   - `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py` deterministic smoke assertions.
3. Map each feature to targeted tests, including exact `uv run python ...` commands.
4. Map each feature to eval regression signals in `evals/chapter-quality.yaml`, `evals/style-guard.yaml`, and `evals/drift-detection.yaml`.
5. Capture a single next implementation task with concrete acceptance criteria and file list.
