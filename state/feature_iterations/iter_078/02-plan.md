# Plan

1. Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `state/feature_iterations/iter_077/06-next-iteration.md`.
2. Add a shared helper in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` for parser-choice and usage-example inclusion assertions.
3. Replace duplicated assertions in the two targeted `run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard*` wrappers with helper calls.
4. Run targeted smoke validation for both updated wrappers.
5. Record execution evidence, validation results, risks, and one next task in iter_078 artifacts.
