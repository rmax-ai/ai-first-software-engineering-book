# Execution

## Commands and tools run
- Read guidance:
  - `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
  - `DEVELOPMENT.md`
  - `.github/instructions/copilot-sdk-python.instructions.md`
- Iteration discovery:
  - searched `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (none found)
- Filesystem changes:
  - created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`
  - created the seven iteration artifacts in this folder

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- Kept scope to one planning task only, as required.
- Established a concrete backlog so follow-up iterations can implement smallest changes with clear verification gates.
