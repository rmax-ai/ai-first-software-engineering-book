# Iteration Summary

This seed iteration established `iter_001` as the first backlog entry under `state/feature_iterations/`.
The task focused on planning custom harness improvements, per prompt instructions.
Artifacts define a concise roadmap for features, tests, and evaluation alignment.
The plan names concrete touchpoints in `state/kernel.py`, role-IO scaffolds, smoke tests, and eval YAMLs.
Validation records how contract compliance was checked and confirms all seven required files exist.
Risks and trade-offs are documented to guide controlled follow-up implementation.
A single next task is recommended: implement deterministic trace lifecycle logging with smoke assertions.
This leaves a clean, actionable handoff for `iter_002`.
