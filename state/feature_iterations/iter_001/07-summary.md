# Summary

- Iteration `iter_001` was created as the seed feature-improvement planning cycle.
- Completed one task: plan custom harness improvements without implementing code.
- Documented acceptance criteria centered on features, tests, and eval alignment.
- Produced a concrete step-by-step plan referencing `state/kernel.py`, role templates, smoke coverage, and eval YAMLs.
- Recorded execution and validation evidence with explicit commands and outcomes.
- Captured risks and deferrals to keep scope minimal and deterministic.
- Defined exactly one next task: implement deterministic trace stage metrics with smoke verification.
