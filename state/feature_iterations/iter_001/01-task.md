# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now

No prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_XXX` exists, so the seed iteration must establish a concrete, testable backlog for improving the custom harness in `state/`.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Produce a concise plan that covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks**.
2. Explicitly map planned work to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and relevant `evals/*.yaml`.
3. Keep this iteration planning-only (no production code edits required).
