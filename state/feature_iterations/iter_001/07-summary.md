# Iteration Summary

Created `iter_001` as the seed feature-improvement iteration.
This iteration intentionally focused on planning rather than code changes.
The artifacts define a concrete backlog for harness improvements in `state/`.
Planned feature work targets kernel observability, role-IO scaffolding, and deterministic smoke coverage.
Validation strategy now ties future changes to smoke commands and eval contracts.
Risks were documented, including implementation uncertainty and deferred runtime proof.
A single next task was proposed: implement kernel trace-envelope improvements with tests.
All seven required markdown handoff files are present and scoped for the next iteration.
