# Iteration summary

This seed feature iteration established the first actionable backlog entry under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001`.
The work intentionally focused on planning, not implementation, per the execution prompt.
Artifacts define a concrete harness roadmap covering feature changes, test strategy, and eval regression detection.
The plan prioritizes deterministic trace observability in `state/kernel.py` as the next implementable unit.
It also scopes follow-up role-IO template hardening and eval contract alignment.
Validation steps were defined in the artifact set and are executed in the next workflow step.
The next iteration is constrained to one task with explicit acceptance criteria and file targets.
