# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Historical iteration markdown files still contain mixed command styles and may confuse future readers.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Updated only active migration guidance and smoke-script usage text for a minimal, low-risk diff.
- Did not mass-edit historical iteration records to avoid high-churn retrospective changes.

## Intentionally deferred
- Backfilling old iteration artifacts with normalized command examples.
