# Plan

1. Confirm the legacy bare snippet exists in `state/migration_iterations/iter_055/06-next-iteration.md`.
2. Apply a one-line edit to normalize that snippet to `uv run python`.
3. Run focused `rg` and `git` evidence commands on the touched file.
4. Write all required `iter_066` artifacts with the executed commands and outcomes.
