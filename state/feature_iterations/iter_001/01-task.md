# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- The execute prompt defines this seed iteration as planning-only and requires a backlog for future implementation iterations.
- There are no prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_XXX` folders, so this is the first required iteration artifact set.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan that covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
- Identify concrete follow-up work touching `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Complete all required iteration artifacts (`01` through `07`) with actionable content.
