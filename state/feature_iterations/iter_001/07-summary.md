# Iteration 001 summary

This seed iteration established the first `state/feature_iterations` record.
The selected task was to plan harness improvements rather than edit runtime code.
The plan explicitly covered features, tests, and evaluation gates.
Feature scope was constrained to `state/kernel.py` and `state/role_io_templates.py`.
Validation scope was mapped to `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py` and `evals/*.yaml`.
Risks and trade-offs were documented with implementation intentionally deferred.
A single next task was provided for iteration 002 with concrete acceptance criteria.
All outputs were written as concise markdown artifacts for handoff.
