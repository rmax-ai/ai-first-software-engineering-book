# Plan

1. Capture the harness improvement backlog as planning-only documentation in this iteration folder.
2. Define feature work for:
   - richer phase/eval trace observability in `state/kernel.py`
   - clearer role scaffold contracts in `state/role_io_templates.py`
   - stronger deterministic smoke coverage in `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`
3. Define test work using targeted `uv run python ...` harness smoke paths and focused unit-level checks for pure helpers.
4. Define eval work by mapping planned behavior to `evals/chapter-quality.yaml`, `evals/style-guard.yaml`, and `evals/drift-detection.yaml`.
5. Record validation evidence showing this plan is consistent with `DEVELOPMENT.md` and the prompt contract.
