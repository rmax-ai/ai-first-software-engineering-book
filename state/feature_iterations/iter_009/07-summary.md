# Summary

Executed one backlog task from `iter_008` by adding deterministic malformed latest-history-entry guard coverage.
Implemented `trace-summary-latest-history-entry-shape-guard` in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
Wired the mode through usage text, CLI choices, help text, and dispatcher routing.
Validated the new mode and confirmed neighboring trace-summary modes remain green.
Ran compile validation to confirm no syntax regressions.
All acceptance criteria were met with minimal, isolated edits.
No unrelated refactors were introduced.
