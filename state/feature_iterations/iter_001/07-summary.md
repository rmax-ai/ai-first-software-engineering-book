# Iteration Summary

This first feature iteration created the required seven-artifact handoff for `iter_001`.
It selected the planning story for improving the custom harness in `state/`.
The plan covers feature work in kernel and role templates, testing updates in smoke scripts, and eval wiring for regression detection.
No production harness code was changed in this seed iteration by design.
Validation confirms all required artifacts exist and align with prompt constraints.
A single concrete next task is provided: implement deterministic trace summary enhancements with smoke verification.
This keeps future work incremental, testable, and consistent with `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
