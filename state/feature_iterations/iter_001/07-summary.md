# Iteration Summary

This seed feature iteration created the required seven-artifact handoff under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
The selected task was planning custom harness improvements rather than implementing runtime changes.
The plan covers three dimensions: feature upgrades (kernel observability and template contracts), testing strategy (unit + deterministic smoke), and evaluation/regression gates (alignment with `evals/*.yaml` and metrics evidence).
Execution remained minimal and scoped to documentation artifacts only.
Validation steps confirm folder completeness, required path references, and narrow diff surface.
Risks and explicit deferrals were recorded to prevent accidental scope expansion.
The next iteration is concretely defined as trace-summary schema hardening with targeted smoke-backed verification.
