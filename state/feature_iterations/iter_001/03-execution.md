# Execution Log

## Commands and tools run
- Read prompt contract: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` (via `view`).
- Read harness development guidance: `DEVELOPMENT.md` (via `view`).
- Checked existing iteration folders: `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (via `glob`).
- Created iteration folder: `mkdir -p state/feature_iterations/iter_001`.

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale per change
- Wrote seed-iteration task and acceptance criteria to constrain scope to planning.
- Added an actionable plan that decomposes future harness work into feature/test/eval tracks.
- Recorded execution and validation evidence so this planning iteration is auditable.
