# Iteration summary

Created `iter_001` as the seed feature-improvement iteration and completed a planning-only task for custom harness improvements.
The task defines why this planning pass is needed now and sets concrete acceptance criteria.
The plan maps future implementation touchpoints across `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and eval contracts.
It explicitly captures expected test strategy and regression detection surfaces tied to `evals/*.yaml` and `state/metrics.json`.
Execution artifacts document commands used and files produced in this iteration.
Risks and decisions highlight scope-control and verification-noise concerns.
One bounded next task is provided: implement deterministic trace-summary observability with smoke validation evidence.
