# Plan

1. Update line 10 wording in `state/migration_iterations/iter_092/01-task.md` to `confirms the normalized snippet mention` while preserving command text.
2. Run focused validation commands (`rg` and `git --no-pager diff`) for the changed file.
3. Record execution, validation, risks, and one next-task handoff in `iter_094` artifacts.
