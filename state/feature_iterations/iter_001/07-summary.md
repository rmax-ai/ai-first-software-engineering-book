# Summary

This seed iteration created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` and completed the full seven-file handoff contract.
The selected task was planning-only: define the custom `state/` harness improvement backlog without implementation edits.
The plan explicitly covers feature targets (`state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`), test strategy, and eval/regression linkage (`evals/*.yaml`, `state/metrics.json` signals).
Validation confirms all required artifacts exist and referenced future-touch files are present.
Primary decision: prioritize deterministic kernel diagnostics in the next iteration as the first executable backlog slice.
Deferred work is intentional and bounded to future iterations, with concrete acceptance criteria documented in `06-next-iteration.md`.
