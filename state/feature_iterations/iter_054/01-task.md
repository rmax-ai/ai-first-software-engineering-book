# Task

## Selected task title
Plan custom state harness improvements.

## Why this task now
`prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines a seed iteration that must produce a concrete harness-improvement plan covering features, tests, and evaluations before additional implementation iterations.

## Acceptance criteria
1. Document a focused improvement story for the harness with explicit features, tests, and eval alignment.
2. Provide an implementation-ready plan that names expected files, including `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
3. Produce all seven required iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_054/`.
