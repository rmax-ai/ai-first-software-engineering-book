# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Repository-wide historical docs still include bare `python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` mentions, so normalization remains incomplete outside this iteration scope.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Scoped this iteration to exactly the two files requested by prior handoff guidance to keep the diff minimal and auditable.
- Avoided broad sweep edits to prevent mixing unrelated historical documentation updates.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Additional normalization in other iteration folders was deferred to the next iteration.
