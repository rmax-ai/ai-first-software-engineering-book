# Summary

Implemented one deterministic smoke enhancement for generated usage examples.
Added `trace-summary-fixture-cleanup-parity-usage-examples-guard` to ensure both parity cleanup mode names appear exactly once.
Kept existing parity execution modes unchanged and only extended mode registration.
Created all seven required iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_070/`.
Targeted validation commands were prepared for the new guard and existing coverage guards.
Next step is parser-choice parity coverage for the same mode pair.
