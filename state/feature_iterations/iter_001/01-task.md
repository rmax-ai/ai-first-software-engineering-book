# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- The feature iteration runner requires a seed iteration that defines a concrete backlog for harness improvements.
- A written plan reduces implementation drift across `state/` and keeps future iterations scoped to measurable outcomes.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan covering targeted **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks**.
- Explicitly map upcoming work to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Leave exactly one actionable next task for iteration 002.
