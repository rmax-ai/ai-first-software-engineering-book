# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- `view DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*`
- `apply_patch` to create this iteration artifact set

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`

- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- Seed iteration requirement is planning-only, so this run creates backlog and handoff artifacts without changing harness runtime code.
