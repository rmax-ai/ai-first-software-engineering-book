# Validation

## Verification actions
- Cross-checked the plan against `DEVELOPMENT.md` guidance for UV usage, target harness files, and eval discipline.
- Verified all seven required artifacts exist under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
- Ran:
  - `ls -1 state/feature_iterations/iter_001`
  - `git --no-pager status --short`

## Results
- Folder contract satisfied: 7/7 files present.
- Plan coverage satisfied: includes features, tests, and evaluations with explicit file paths.
- Working tree shows intended updates to the seven iteration artifacts only.

## Acceptance criteria status
- **Pass**: Iteration defines a concise, actionable custom harness improvement plan.
