# Summary

Created iteration `iter_043` and completed one scoped feature-improvement task.
Added a deterministic guard handler for `usage-examples-duplicate-count-mode-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard` in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
Registered the new mode in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` so argparse choices and usage examples include it.
Executed the two required smoke validations from the previous iteration handoff.
Captured execution details, validation evidence, risks, decisions, and one concrete next task for `iter_044`.
Kept scope minimal with no unrelated refactors or interface changes.
