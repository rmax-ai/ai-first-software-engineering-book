# Task

## Selected task title
Backfill `iter_026` execution/validation artifacts to replace bare smoke-test `python` snippets with `uv run python`.

## Why this task now
`iter_053/06-next-iteration.md` designated `iter_026` command-snippet normalization as the next smallest unfinished migration-doc task.

## Acceptance criteria
- Update smoke-test command snippets in `state/migration_iterations/iter_026/03-execution.md` and `state/migration_iterations/iter_026/04-validation.md` from `python ...` to `uv run python ...`.
- Keep non-command narrative unchanged.
- Capture targeted diff/search evidence for the touched files.
