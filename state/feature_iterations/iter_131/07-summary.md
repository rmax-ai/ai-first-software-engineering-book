# Summary

- Executed one backlog task from prior iteration guidance (`iter_130/06-next-iteration.md`).
- Added a new smoke guard function that verifies `...order-uniqueness-order-guard` appears exactly once in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS`.
- Registered one new mode: `...order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-guard`.
- Ran the targeted smoke command and observed PASS output.
- Kept the code diff minimal and localized to `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
- Wrote all seven required iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_131/`.
- Documented risks and selected one concrete next task for iter_132.
