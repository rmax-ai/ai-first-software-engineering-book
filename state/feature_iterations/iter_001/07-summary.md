# Iteration summary

This seed iteration completed the planning-focused backlog setup requested by the runner prompt.
A new iteration folder `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` was created with all seven required markdown artifacts.
The selected task defined acceptance criteria centered on feature, test, and evaluation planning coverage.
The plan now maps concrete future touchpoints across `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
Execution and validation artifacts document discovery, file creation, and explicit contract checks.
Risks and decisions were captured to prevent drift and preserve deterministic behavior expectations.
The recommended next iteration is a single, actionable implementation task: deterministic trace-summary instrumentation with smoke validation.
