# Iteration Summary

This seed feature iteration established a planning baseline for custom harness improvements.
A new `iter_001` folder was created with the full seven-artifact contract.
The task and plan focus on future work in `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
The plan explicitly covers feature behavior, test strategy, and eval/regression alignment.
Validation confirms all required artifacts exist and satisfy prompt requirements.
No harness code was changed in this iteration by design.
The handoff recommends implementing deterministic trace-summary checkpoints next.
