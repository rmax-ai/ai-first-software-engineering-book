# Summary

Executed one unfinished backlog task from `iter_011` by adding deterministic chapter-metrics shape guard coverage.
Added `trace-summary-chapter-metrics-shape-guard` to `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
Wired the mode through usage docs, mode descriptions, CLI choices, help text, and mode dispatch.
Validated the new mode plus adjacent trace-summary modes.
Verified syntax with `py_compile`.
Recorded repository test status via `uv run pytest -q` (no collected tests).
Captured complete handoff artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_012/`.
All acceptance criteria for this iteration were met with a minimal, targeted diff.
