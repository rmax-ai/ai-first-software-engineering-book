# Summary

This iteration executed one backlog task from `iter_111/06-next-iteration.md`.
The smoke harness gained a new deterministic mode that enforces adjacency between the newest uniqueness guard mode and `usage-examples-order-guard`.
`state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` now includes `run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_wrapper_helper_uniqueness_order_adjacency_order_uniqueness_adjacency_uniqueness_adjacency_guard_mode`.
`TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` now registers that mode with deterministic description text.
Mode ordering was minimally adjusted so the guarded adjacency is true.
Targeted validation ran with `uv run python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py --mode usage-examples-duplicate-count-wrapper-helper-uniqueness-order-adjacency-order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-guard`.
Validation output was PASS with exit code 0.
All seven required markdown artifacts were written to `state/feature_iterations/iter_112/`.
A single next task was recommended for the subsequent iteration.
