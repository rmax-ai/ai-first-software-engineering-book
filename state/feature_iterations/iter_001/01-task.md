# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
The feature-iteration backlog is empty, and the execution prompt seeds the first iteration as a planning task for the custom harness in `state/`. Creating a clear plan now establishes the prioritized backlog and constraints for later implementation iterations.

## Acceptance criteria
- Define a concise feature-improvement story covering harness features, tests, and eval alignment.
- Provide a concrete implementation plan touching `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Record validation evidence showing the plan was cross-checked against `DEVELOPMENT.md` and current harness/eval surfaces.
