# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as planning-only.
- A concrete backlog is needed before touching `state/kernel.py` and related harness modules.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan covering **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations** for harness improvements.
- Scope later work to explicit files: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Provide one actionable next iteration task with measurable verification criteria.
