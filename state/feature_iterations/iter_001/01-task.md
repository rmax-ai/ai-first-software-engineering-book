# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- The execute prompt defines this as the seed iteration and requires a concrete backlog before implementation work begins.
- A shared plan reduces risk when touching `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, and eval contracts.

## Acceptance criteria
- Provide a concise feature plan for harness improvements covering behavior, observability, and deterministic controls.
- Define targeted tests to validate each planned capability.
- Define evaluation mappings to existing gates under `evals/` and harness metrics outputs.
- Keep scope to planning only (no harness code implementation in this iteration).
