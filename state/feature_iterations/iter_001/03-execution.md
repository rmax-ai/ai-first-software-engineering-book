# Execution Log

## Commands/tools run
- Read prompt: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read guidance: `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Determined iteration index by listing `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (none found, created `iter_001`)
- Wrote iteration artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- This seed iteration is planning-only; no harness code paths were modified.
- Artifacts establish a concrete backlog for upcoming implementation iterations.
