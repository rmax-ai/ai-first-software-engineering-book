# Summary

This iteration completed one backlog task from `iter_133/06-next-iteration.md`.
A new smoke guard runner now enforces adjacency ordering for the newest `...order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-guard` mode.
`TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` now includes a matching `...order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-guard` registration.
The code change was constrained to `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
Validation was targeted to the new mode and captured a PASS result in `04-validation.md`.
No unrelated refactors were introduced.
The next recommended task is uniqueness-count coverage for the newly added adjacency-order guard mode.
