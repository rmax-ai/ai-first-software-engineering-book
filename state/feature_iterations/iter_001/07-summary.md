# Iteration summary

- Created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` as the first feature iteration folder.
- Executed the seed prompt as a planning-only iteration with no harness runtime code edits.
- Authored `01-task.md` with rationale and acceptance criteria focused on features/tests/evals.
- Authored `02-plan.md` with an implementation sequence targeting `state/kernel.py`, role I/O templates, smoke tests, and eval YAMLs.
- Logged execution and validation evidence in `03-execution.md` and `04-validation.md`.
- Captured major planning risks, key decisions, and deferrals in `05-risks-and-decisions.md`.
- Recommended exactly one next task in `06-next-iteration.md`: deterministic trace checkpoints in the kernel.
