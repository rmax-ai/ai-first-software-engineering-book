# Iteration summary

This iteration completed the seed planning task defined by the execution prompt.
I created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` with all seven required artifacts.
The task/plan documents define a concise improvement backlog for the custom harness.
Coverage explicitly includes feature needs, targeted test strategy, and eval alignment.
No runtime code paths were modified; this was documentation-only by design.
Validation confirmed the artifact contract and required file-path references.
The next iteration is scoped to deterministic phase-trace summary enrichment with smoke verification.
