# Plan

1. Confirm prior guidance from `state/migration_iterations/iter_070/06-next-iteration.md`.
2. Apply a one-line edit in `state/migration_iterations/iter_068/04-validation.md` command 1 to normalize snippet wording.
3. Run targeted validation commands (`rg` and `git --no-pager diff`) for the edited file.
4. Write all required iteration artifacts under `state/migration_iterations/iter_071/`.
