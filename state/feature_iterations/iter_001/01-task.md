# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_XXX/` exists, and `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as a planning pass for improving the custom harness in `state/`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise, actionable plan that covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
- Scope includes planned future work for `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, relevant `evals/*.yaml`, and supporting harness assets.
- Provide one concrete next iteration task with explicit acceptance criteria and expected touched files.
