# Plan

1. Confirm the legacy fallback-error snippet mention exists in `state/migration_iterations/iter_082/01-task.md`.
2. Apply a minimal one-line edit to normalize wording to `uv run python`.
3. Run targeted `rg` and `git --no-pager diff` validation for the changed file.
4. Record execution/validation evidence and handoff in iteration artifacts.
