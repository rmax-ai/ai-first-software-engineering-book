# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines this seed iteration as planning-only.
- The harness product surface in `state/` needs a concrete, sequenced backlog before implementation work.

## Acceptance criteria
1. Provide a concise plan that covers new harness features, targeted tests, and regression eval coverage.
2. Explicitly map planned work to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, `evals/*.yaml`, and supporting harness assets.
3. Document how the plan was validated against current repository guidance (`DEVELOPMENT.md`) and execution constraints.
