# Iteration Summary

- Created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` as the initial feature-improvement iteration.
- Executed the seed task: plan custom harness improvements rather than implement code changes.
- Documented acceptance criteria and a concise plan spanning feature work, tests, and eval regression coverage.
- Explicitly mapped future work to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Recorded execution and validation artifacts for traceability.
- Captured risks and deferrals to keep scope intentionally narrow.
- Produced one concrete next task focused on deterministic trace-summary emission in the kernel.
