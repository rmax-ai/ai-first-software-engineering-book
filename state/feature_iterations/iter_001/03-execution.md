# Execution log

## Commands/tools run
- Read prompt contract: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read governance guidance: `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Enumerated candidate harness/eval files (`state/*.py`, `evals/*.yaml`)
- Created iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- Seed iteration is planning-only per prompt; no production harness code changes were made.
