# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
This is the seed feature iteration requested by `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` and establishes a concrete, reviewable backlog before implementation work starts.

## Acceptance criteria
- Provide a concise improvement plan covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks**.
- Name concrete files for planned future work, including `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Keep scope to planning only (no runtime behavior changes in this iteration).
