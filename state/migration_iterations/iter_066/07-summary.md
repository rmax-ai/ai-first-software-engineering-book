# Summary

This iteration completed one migration cleanup task from prior handoff guidance.
The change normalized a remaining bare `fallback-error` smoke command snippet in `state/migration_iterations/iter_055/06-next-iteration.md`.
Only one line was edited to enforce `uv run python` wording.
Targeted validation used `rg` plus `git show` evidence for commit `b0f3604`.
All required iteration artifacts were created under `state/migration_iterations/iter_066/`.
No runtime behavior or code paths were changed; this was a documentation/handoff normalization task.
The next recommended task is to normalize the adjacent legacy snippet reference in `iter_065/06-next-iteration.md`.
