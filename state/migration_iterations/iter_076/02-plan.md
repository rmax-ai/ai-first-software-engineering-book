# Plan

1. Verify the fallback-error snippet mention in `state/migration_iterations/iter_074/01-task.md` acceptance criteria.
2. Apply a one-line wording normalization from bare `python` snippet text to `uv run python` wording.
3. Run focused `rg` checks and inspect scoped diff evidence for the edited file.
4. Record task execution and validation in the seven required iteration artifacts.
