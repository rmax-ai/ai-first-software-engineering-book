# Summary
- Created the initial feature iteration folder at `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
- Executed the seed requirement as a planning-only iteration for custom harness improvements.
- Documented task framing, acceptance criteria, and a concrete implementation plan.
- Mapped future work across features, tests, and eval/regression detection surfaces.
- Recorded execution evidence and validation checks for artifact completeness.
- Captured risks and explicit deferrals to keep this iteration minimal.
- Provided exactly one next recommended task with concrete acceptance criteria and target files.
