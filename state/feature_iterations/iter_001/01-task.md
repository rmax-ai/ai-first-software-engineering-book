# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- No prior feature iteration exists, so the seed iteration must establish a concrete, testable backlog for harness improvements.
- A written plan reduces execution drift across future iterations and aligns work with `DEVELOPMENT.md` and eval contracts.

## Acceptance criteria
- Define a prioritized feature backlog for harness improvements with explicit scope.
- Map each planned feature to targeted verification commands/tests.
- Map planned work to evaluation surfaces under `evals/` and expected regression signals.
- Keep the iteration implementation-only scope to planning artifacts (no harness code changes).
