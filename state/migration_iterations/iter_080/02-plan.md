# Plan

1. Confirm the pre-edit escaped snippet in `state/migration_iterations/iter_078/01-task.md`.
2. Apply a one-line replacement in that acceptance-criteria command snippet.
3. Run targeted `rg` and scoped `git diff` validation commands.
4. Record execution, validation, risks/decisions, and next task in iteration artifacts.
