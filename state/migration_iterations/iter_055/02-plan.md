# Plan

1. Edit the two targeted `iter_026` handoff files and only change bare smoke-test command snippets.
2. Run focused `rg` checks to confirm no bare `python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` snippets remain in those files.
3. Record commit-scoped diff evidence and summarize outcomes in iteration artifacts.

## Files expected to change
- `state/migration_iterations/iter_026/01-task.md`
- `state/migration_iterations/iter_026/06-next-iteration.md`
