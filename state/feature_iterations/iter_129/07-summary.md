# Summary

This iteration completed the highest-priority backlog item from `iter_128/06-next-iteration.md`.
A new uniqueness-count smoke mode function was added to assert the newest `...order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-order-guard` mode appears exactly once.
The new `...order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-order-uniqueness-guard` mode was registered in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` with deterministic wording.
Targeted smoke validation was executed and returned PASS for the new mode.
All seven required artifacts were written under `state/feature_iterations/iter_129/`.
The diff remained tightly scoped to one smoke-test module and iteration documentation.
