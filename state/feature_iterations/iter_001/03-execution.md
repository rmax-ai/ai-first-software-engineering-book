## Rationale by change
- `01-task.md`: captured scope and acceptance criteria for the seed planning iteration.
- `02-plan.md`: created a stepwise backlog covering features, tests, and eval alignment.
- `03-execution.md`: documented concrete actions and produced artifact traceability.
- `04-validation.md`: records verification commands and pass/fail outcomes.
- `05-risks-and-decisions.md`: captures planning risk posture and explicit deferrals.
- `06-next-iteration.md`: defines one implementation task for the next loop.
- `07-summary.md`: concise executive handoff of outcomes.
