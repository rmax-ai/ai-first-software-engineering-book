# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Prior handoff guidance referenced a snippet as still legacy even though adjacent historical files had already been normalized, so stale guidance drift remains possible.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Followed latest-iteration guidance (`iter_067`) and applied the exact requested normalization in `iter_064` with a minimal one-line edit.
- Chose not to refactor older historical evidence files because this iteration is scoped to one smallest unfinished task.

## Intentionally deferred
- Broader cleanup of historical command examples in older iteration artifacts remains deferred to future one-file normalization tasks.
