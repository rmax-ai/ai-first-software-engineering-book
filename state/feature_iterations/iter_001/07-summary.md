# Iteration summary

This seed iteration created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` and completed the required seven-artifact contract.
The selected task was planning-only: define a practical harness improvement backlog before implementation.
The backlog covers three areas explicitly: kernel/role-template/smoke **features**, targeted **tests**, and regression **evals**.
The plan maps future work to concrete files in `state/` and `evals/` to keep follow-on changes scoped and auditable.
Validation confirmed there were no prior iterations, making `iter_001` the correct index.
No runtime behavior changed in this iteration, reducing risk while establishing execution structure.
A single next task was chosen: deterministic trace-summary observability with matching smoke validation.
That recommendation is designed to produce the first measurable harness improvement with minimal surface area.
