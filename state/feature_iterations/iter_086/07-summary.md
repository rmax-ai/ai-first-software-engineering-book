# Summary

This iteration completed one small helper-rollout task from the previous handoff.
Two duplicate-count coverage-guard wrappers were migrated to `_run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard(...)`.
The migrated wrappers correspond to the 13-guard and 14-guard mode variants.
Wrapper names and PASS output strings were preserved.
Two required smoke commands were executed for the touched modes.
Iteration artifacts `01` through `07` were written under `state/feature_iterations/iter_086/`.
The next recommendation continues the same two-wrapper incremental rollout pattern.
