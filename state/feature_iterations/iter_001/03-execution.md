- Discovered existing iterations via glob on `state/feature_iterations/iter_*`
- Created folder: `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`
- Wrote seven required markdown artifacts.

- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
This seed iteration intentionally delivers planning artifacts only, creating a practical backlog and handoff for the next single implementation task.
