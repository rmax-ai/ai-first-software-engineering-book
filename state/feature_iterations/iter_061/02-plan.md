# Plan

1. Run all four trace-summary smoke modes with `--run-kernel-for-trace-summary` and capture raw outputs.
2. Determine whether failures come from smoke logic or kernel eligibility state.
3. If blocked by environment state, document bounded unblock guidance instead of broad refactoring.
4. Write the seven required `iter_061` artifacts with evidence and one next task.
