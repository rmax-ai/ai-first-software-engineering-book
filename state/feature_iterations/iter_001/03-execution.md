# Execution log

## Commands/tools run
- Read prompt contract: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read harness guidance: `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Discovered feature-iteration baseline via glob on `state/feature_iterations/iter_*`
- Created folder: `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`
- Authored required markdown artifacts for this planning iteration

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale per change
- Created a complete seed backlog package that satisfies the prompt's required seven-artifact contract.
- Kept this iteration planning-only so future iterations can execute in narrow, verifiable slices.
