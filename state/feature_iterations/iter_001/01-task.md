# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- This is the seed feature iteration and no prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_XXX` guidance exists.
- A concrete plan is needed before making harness behavior changes in `state/`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Document a concise backlog covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **evals**.
- Provide a step-by-step implementation sequence for later iterations touching:
  - `state/kernel.py`
  - `state/role_io_templates.py`
  - `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`
  - `evals/*.yaml`
- Record validation evidence that the plan aligns with `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
