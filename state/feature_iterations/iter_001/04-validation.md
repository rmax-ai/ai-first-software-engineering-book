# Validation

## Verification steps
- Confirmed all seven required artifact files exist under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
- Cross-checked plan scope against `DEVELOPMENT.md` guidance (UV usage, harness files, eval contract alignment).
- Reviewed `06-next-iteration.md` to ensure exactly one follow-up task with concrete acceptance criteria.

## Observed results
- Artifact set is complete and follows the required naming/ordering contract.
- Plan content covers features, tests, and evals with explicit file paths.
- No unsupported implementation claims or unrun test claims were made.

## Acceptance criteria status
- Plan includes required feature/test/eval coverage: **PASS**
- Future touchpoints are explicit: **PASS**
- Exactly one next task is recommended: **PASS**
