# Summary

This iteration executed one backlog task from `iter_121/06-next-iteration.md`.
A new smoke guard mode was added to assert the newest adjacency mode appears immediately before the related uniqueness mode.
The mode was registered with deterministic description text in the trace-summary mode sequence.
No unrelated logic or interfaces were changed.
Targeted verification ran with the new mode and returned PASS with exit code 0.
All seven required artifacts for `iter_122` were written in `state/feature_iterations/iter_122/`.
The next iteration recommends uniqueness hardening for the newly added adjacency mode.
