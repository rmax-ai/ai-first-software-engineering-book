# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
This is the seed iteration required by `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`, and it establishes the backlog for subsequent implementation iterations.

## Acceptance criteria
- Provide a concise improvement plan covering harness features, tests, and eval/regression checks.
- Name concrete files for future implementation (`state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, `evals/*.yaml`).
- Leave exactly one recommended next task with measurable acceptance criteria.
