# Summary

Completed one bounded backlog task from the prior iteration handoff.
Added a smoke guard mode that asserts the helper mode-order guard is immediately followed by the helper uniqueness-adjacency guard in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS`.
Registered the new guard mode with deterministic text in the trace summary mode registry.
Executed the targeted smoke validation mode and captured PASS evidence.
Wrote all seven required iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_106/`.
Kept scope minimal with no unrelated refactors.
