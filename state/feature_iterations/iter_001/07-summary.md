# Iteration summary

This iteration created the initial `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` handoff set.
It followed the seed requirement to focus on planning rather than implementation.
The backlog now explicitly covers harness feature work in `state/kernel.py` and `state/role_io_templates.py`.
It also defines smoke-test expansion in `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py` and eval alignment with `evals/*.yaml`.
Validation was documentation-focused and confirmed all seven required artifacts.
The next iteration is narrowed to one smallest executable task: trace-summary guard events plus deterministic smoke coverage.
This keeps future work incremental, testable, and aligned with `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
