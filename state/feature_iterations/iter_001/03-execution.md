# Execution

## Commands and tools run
- `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- `view DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*`
- `apply_patch` to create iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`

- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale per change
- `01-task.md`: captured the selected seed task and iteration acceptance criteria.
- `02-plan.md`: translated seed prompt requirements into an implementation-ready backlog plan.
- `03-execution.md`: documented actual execution steps and touched paths for traceability.
- `04-validation.md`: records objective checks for artifact completeness and acceptance criteria.
- `05-risks-and-decisions.md`: preserved decisions, trade-offs, and deferred concerns.
- `06-next-iteration.md`: defines one concrete next task and measurable acceptance criteria.
- `07-summary.md`: provides concise executive handoff for future iterations.
