# Iteration Summary

This seed iteration established the first feature-improvement artifact pack at `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
The task was intentionally planning-only, per prompt requirements.
Artifacts define harness improvement scope across features, tests, and evaluations.
The plan identifies future updates for `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
Execution and validation records are included with explicit commands and pass/fail outcomes.
Risks were documented to prevent over-scoped follow-up iterations.
A single concrete next task was selected: deterministic trace-decision observability with smoke/eval alignment.
No production harness code was changed in this iteration.
