# Iteration summary

This seed iteration created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` and completed the seven-file contract.
The selected task is a planning story for custom harness improvements in `state/`.
The plan now explicitly covers feature additions, targeted smoke/unit validations, and eval-regression mapping.
No production code changed in this iteration by design.
Validation confirmed all required artifacts exist and align with the prompt contract.
Key risk is plan drift if harness internals evolve before implementation.
A single next task is defined: implement deterministic trace-summary instrumentation and matching smoke guards.
This leaves a clear, testable handoff for the next autonomous iteration.
