# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as a planning pass.
- A concrete backlog is required before implementation iterations touch harness code.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise improvement plan covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks**.
- Scope the plan to concrete files: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Define one actionable next implementation task with measurable acceptance criteria.
