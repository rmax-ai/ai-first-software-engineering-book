# Summary

This iteration executed one backlog task from `iter_118/06-next-iteration.md`.
A new smoke guard mode was added to assert the latest uniqueness mode appears immediately before its predecessor mode in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS`.
The mode was registered with deterministic description text in the trace-summary mode sequence.
No unrelated logic or interfaces were changed.
Targeted verification ran with the new mode and returned PASS with exit code 0.
All seven required artifacts for `iter_119` were written in `state/feature_iterations/iter_119/`.
The next iteration recommends uniqueness hardening for the new adjacency mode.
