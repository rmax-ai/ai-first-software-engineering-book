# Summary

Created iteration `iter_084` and executed one scoped migration task from the prior handoff.
The task normalized a remaining escaped fallback-error command snippet in `iter_082/01-task.md`.
Only one line changed in the target historical artifact.
Validation used targeted `rg` and `git diff` checks and confirmed the expected wording update.
No runtime code paths or interfaces were modified.
Risks were limited to deferred wording cleanup in other historical iteration artifacts.
A single concrete next task was documented for `iter_083/01-task.md`.
This keeps the migration-iteration cleanup sequence incremental and low-risk.
