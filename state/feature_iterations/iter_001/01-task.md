# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- This is the seed iteration from `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` and establishes the actionable backlog for future implementation iterations.
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` requires deterministic harness work in `state/` with explicit verification and eval alignment.

## Acceptance criteria
1. Produce a concise improvement plan that covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression detection**.
2. Define concrete follow-up work touching `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml` as needed.
3. Record one recommended next iteration task with measurable acceptance criteria and expected files.
