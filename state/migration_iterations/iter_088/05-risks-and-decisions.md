# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Similar legacy fallback-error wording may still exist in other historical iteration artifacts.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Followed prior-iteration guidance exactly and performed a targeted verification-first check.
- Chose a no-op content change for the target file because no escaped legacy snippet was present.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Further wording cleanup outside `iter_083/05-risks-and-decisions.md` is deferred to the next single-task iteration.
