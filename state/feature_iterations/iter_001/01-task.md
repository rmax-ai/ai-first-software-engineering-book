# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- The feature-iteration stream has no prior backlog, so a seed plan is required before implementation iterations can proceed safely.
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` prioritizes deterministic harness behavior in `state/`, so the first step is defining scoped improvements and verification expectations.

## Acceptance criteria
- Document a concise backlog of harness improvements covering features, tests, and eval alignment.
- Define concrete follow-up tasks that can be executed in future single-task iterations.
- Keep scope planning-only (no harness code changes in this iteration).
