# Plan

1. Convert exactly two remaining duplicate-count coverage-guard wrappers in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` to helper delegation.
2. Preserve wrapper function names, mode names, and PASS strings verbatim.
3. Execute the two required smoke modes for the touched wrappers.
4. Record evidence and handoff details in `state/feature_iterations/iter_090/03-07` artifacts.
