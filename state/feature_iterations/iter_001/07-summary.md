# Iteration summary

This seed iteration completed the planning-only requirement from `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.  
No prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` folders were present, so `iter_001` was initialized.  
The iteration produced the full seven-artifact contract under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.  
`01-task.md` defines the story and acceptance criteria focused on features, tests, and eval mappings.  
`02-plan.md` provides a concise backlog and sequencing across `state/kernel.py`, role IO scaffolds, smoke checks, and eval YAMLs.  
Validation confirms artifact completeness and planning-only scope.  
Risks and trade-offs were captured to avoid broad follow-up changes.  
The next iteration is scoped to one concrete, verifiable observability improvement in `state/kernel.py`.
