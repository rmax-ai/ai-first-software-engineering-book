# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Remaining legacy snippet mentions still exist in older execution/validation artifacts, so wording cleanup is not globally complete.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Per execution prompt rules, performed exactly one smallest unfinished task and avoided broader historical cleanup.

## Intentionally deferred
- Any additional fallback-error snippet wording normalization outside `state/migration_iterations/iter_082/01-task.md`.
