# Plan

1. Inspect nearby long-form duplicate-count wrapper helpers in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
2. Add one new adjacency-order guard runner using the established naming/pattern style.
3. Wire the new runner into `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` with a unique mode name and description.
4. Execute the targeted smoke mode and record output.
5. Write iteration handoff artifacts.
