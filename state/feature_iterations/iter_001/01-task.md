# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
This repository has no prior `state/feature_iterations` task record, so the seed iteration must define a clear backlog before implementation work starts.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks**.
- Scope later implementation to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Leave exactly one concrete next task for iteration 002 with measurable completion criteria.
