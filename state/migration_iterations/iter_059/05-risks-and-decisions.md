# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Low risk: this was a one-line historical documentation normalization in an existing iteration artifact.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Followed `iter_058` guidance exactly and limited scope to one file to keep the change auditable.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Deferred additional historical snippet cleanup outside the single-task boundary.
