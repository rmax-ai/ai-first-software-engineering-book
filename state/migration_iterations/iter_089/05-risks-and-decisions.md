# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Additional historical iteration artifacts may still reference legacy command wording.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Followed prior-iteration guidance exactly and limited the change to a single targeted line.
- Avoided unrelated artifact rewrites to keep the iteration diff minimal and reviewable.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Further historical wording normalization outside `iter_083/06-next-iteration.md` is deferred to the next single-task iteration.
