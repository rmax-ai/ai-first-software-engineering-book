# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `state/feature_iterations/` has no prior iterations, and the execution prompt requires a seed planning iteration first.
- A clear plan reduces risk before touching core harness files like `state/kernel.py`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Define a concise backlog covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks**.
- Include explicit references to future touchpoints: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Produce all seven required iteration artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
