# Summary

Created iteration `iter_091` and completed one scoped migration-artifact cleanup task.
The task corrected residual evidence phrasing in `state/migration_iterations/iter_080/01-task.md`.
A one-line edit changed `confirms pre-edit legacy wording` to `confirms the normalized snippet mention`.
Targeted validation confirmed the old phrase is absent and the new phrase is present.
Scoped diff evidence showed only the intended one-line change.
All seven required `iter_091` handoff artifacts were added.
No runtime code, interfaces, or behavior were modified.
A single concrete next cleanup task was documented for `iter_092`.
