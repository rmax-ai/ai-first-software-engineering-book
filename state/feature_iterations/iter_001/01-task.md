# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior feature iteration exists yet, so this seed iteration defines the backlog and quality bar for custom harness enhancements before implementation work begins.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan that covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks**.
- Identify concrete future touchpoints across `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, `evals/*.yaml`, and supporting test assets.
- Leave exactly one next task with actionable acceptance criteria.
