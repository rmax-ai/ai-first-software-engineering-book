# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- No prior `state/feature_iterations/` backlog exists, so a seed plan is required before implementation iterations.
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` prioritizes deterministic harness evolution in `state/` with explicit validation and eval linkage.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise improvement plan that explicitly covers features, tests, and eval/regression signals.
- Identify concrete follow-up work touching `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Leave one actionable next task with bounded scope and verifiable outcomes.
