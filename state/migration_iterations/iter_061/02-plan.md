# Plan

1. Edit one line in `state/migration_iterations/iter_046/06-next-iteration.md` to normalize the live smoke command snippet.
2. Run targeted validation: search for the updated command and inspect file-specific diff evidence.
3. Record execution and validation evidence in iteration artifacts.
