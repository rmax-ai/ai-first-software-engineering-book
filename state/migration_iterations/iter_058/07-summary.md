# Summary

Created `iter_058` and completed one smallest unfinished migration handoff task.
The task came directly from `iter_057/06-next-iteration.md` and targeted `iter_046/01-task.md`.
A single line was updated to replace bare `python` with `uv run python` for the live smoke command snippet.
Focused validation confirmed the normalized snippet exists and the old exact snippet is absent.
Git evidence showed only the intended historical file changed for the task edit.
All seven required markdown artifacts were written under `state/migration_iterations/iter_058/`.
Risk remained low by keeping scope to one documentation normalization and deferring broader cleanup.
The next iteration recommends another adjacent one-line normalization in `iter_046/02-plan.md`.
