# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior `state/feature_iterations/` backlog exists, so this seed iteration must define the highest-priority harness improvement plan that future iterations can execute.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
- Identify concrete touchpoints in `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Provide exactly one next iteration task with explicit acceptance criteria and expected files.
