Contents Preface \u2013 foundational motivation and thesis for the AI-first engineering approach. Chapters \u2013 structured research chapters covering paradigm shifts, harness engineering, autonomous kernels, memory systems, evaluation, governance, and production infrastructure. Patterns \u2013 reusable engineering patterns curated from the repository. Glossary \u2013 operational definitions and terminology used throughout the book.
