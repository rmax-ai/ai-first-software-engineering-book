# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior `state/feature_iterations/` iteration exists, and the seed iteration in `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` requires establishing a concrete, testable backlog for harness improvements.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise improvement plan covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression detection**.
- Explicitly map planned work to: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Define one smallest next implementation task with clear acceptance criteria and file targets.
