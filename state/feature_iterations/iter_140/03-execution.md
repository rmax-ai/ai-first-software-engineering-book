# Execution

## Commands/tools run
1. Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `state/feature_iterations/iter_139/06-next-iteration.md`.
2. Edited `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` to add the new adjacency-order runner and mode registration.
3. Ran targeted validation command for the new smoke mode.

## Files changed
- `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_140/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_140/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_140/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_140/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_140/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_140/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_140/07-summary.md`

## Short rationale per change
- Added deterministic adjacency coverage for the newest long-form uniqueness-order mode pair.
- Registered one targeted smoke mode to keep verification scope minimal and explicit.
- Captured full iteration handoff artifacts for the next task.
