# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
`prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as a planning-only pass to establish a concrete backlog for improving the custom harness in `state/`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Provide a concise plan that covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression** signals.
- Name concrete files for likely follow-up implementation work.
- Leave one focused next iteration task with clear acceptance criteria.
