# Validation

## Verification actions run
- Prompt contract review against `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.
- Governance/engineering alignment review against `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- Artifact completeness check for required files `01-task.md` through `07-summary.md`.

## Observed results
- Seed objective met: this iteration contains a planning-only backlog with explicit features/tests/evals coverage.
- All seven required markdown artifacts are present under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
- No code path changed; runtime tests were not required for this documentation-only iteration.

## Acceptance criteria status
- Planning coverage for features/tests/evals: **PASS**
- Concrete file path coverage for future work: **PASS**
- Exactly one next task specified: **PASS**
