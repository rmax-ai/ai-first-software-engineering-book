# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- This stream edits historical iteration artifacts; over-editing could blur historical fidelity.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Kept scope to one targeted line in `iter_070/01-task.md` to satisfy the handoff while preserving artifact context.
- Used only focused text checks instead of broader test runs because no runtime code changed.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Remaining historical bare snippet mentions in other iteration artifacts were deferred to future single-task cleanup iterations.
