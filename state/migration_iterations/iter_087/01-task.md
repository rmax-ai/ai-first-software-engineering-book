# Task

## Selected task title
Normalize escaped fallback-error snippet wording in `state/migration_iterations/iter_083/04-validation.md`.

## Why this task now
This is the highest-priority next step from `iter_086/06-next-iteration.md` and is a single-line, low-risk cleanup.

## Acceptance criteria for this iteration
- Replace escaped ``\`python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py --mode fallback-error\``` wording with ``\`uv run python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py --mode fallback-error\``` in `state/migration_iterations/iter_083/04-validation.md`.
- Capture targeted `rg` evidence and scoped `git --no-pager diff` output.
