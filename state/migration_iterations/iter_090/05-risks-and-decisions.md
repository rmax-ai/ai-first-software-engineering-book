# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Similar residual phrasing may remain in adjacent historical iteration artifacts.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Treated `iter_089` guidance as effectively complete for snippet normalization and corrected the remaining wording mismatch in the same file.
- Kept the change to one line to preserve reviewability and avoid unrelated history edits.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Additional phrase-alignment cleanup in neighboring iteration artifacts is deferred to the next single-task iteration.
