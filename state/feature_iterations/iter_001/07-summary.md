# Summary

This seed feature iteration established the first `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` handoff set.
The task selected was planning custom state harness improvements, per prompt requirements.
The plan explicitly covers required feature surfaces in `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, and `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`.
It also maps future verification to UV-run smoke/kernel commands and regression checks in `evals/*.yaml`.
No implementation files were modified in this planning-only iteration.
Validation confirms all seven required artifacts exist and include required coverage references.
A single concrete next task was defined: add deterministic phase-trace schema guards.
That next task includes scoped acceptance criteria and expected touched files for iter_002.
