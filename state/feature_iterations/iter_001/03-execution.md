# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- Read prompt contract: `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read harness guidance: `view DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Checked existing feature iterations: `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*`
- Created artifact folder: `mkdir -p state/feature_iterations/iter_001`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
Implemented the seed iteration as planning-only work to create a clear, verifiable backlog for custom harness improvements before any code changes.
