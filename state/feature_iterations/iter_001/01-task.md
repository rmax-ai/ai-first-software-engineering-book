# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
The feature-improvement track has no prior iterations, so a concrete, reviewable plan is needed before implementation work starts.

## Acceptance criteria
- Document a prioritized harness backlog that covers features, tests, and evaluations.
- Name concrete files likely to change in follow-up iterations.
- Keep scope limited to planning (no harness behavior changes in this iteration).
