# Plan

1. Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `state/feature_iterations/iter_042/06-next-iteration.md` to confirm scope.
2. Extend `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` with one new duplicate-count usage-example coverage guard function for the next suffix length.
3. Register the new guard mode in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` so argparse choices and generated usage examples include it.
4. Run the two required smoke commands for parser-choice and usage-example coverage.
5. Record evidence and decisions in iteration artifacts.
