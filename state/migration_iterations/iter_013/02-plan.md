# Plan

## Step-by-step plan for this single task
1. Confirm chapter eligibility from `state/ledger.json`.
2. Run file-driven kernel regression on `01-paradigm-shift`.
3. If file-driven mode is blocked by missing role outputs, rerun in `--llm --llm-provider mock` mode to test migration-relevant LLM path.
4. Record pass/fail evidence and bounded unblock action.
