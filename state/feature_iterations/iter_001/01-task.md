# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- The feature iteration prompt seeds the backlog by requiring a planning-first iteration for the custom harness.
- A concrete plan is needed before implementation work touches `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, smoke tests, and eval contracts.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan that covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks**.
- Define follow-up tasks with concrete file targets and verifiable outcomes.
- Keep scope planning-only (no harness code behavior changes in this iteration).
