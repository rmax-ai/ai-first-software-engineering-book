# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines this seed iteration as a planning pass.
- A concrete backlog is required before implementing harness changes in `state/`.

## Acceptance criteria
1. Produce a concise plan covering **features**, **tests**, and **evals** for harness improvements.
2. Call out concrete target files, including:
   - `state/kernel.py`
   - `state/role_io_templates.py`
   - `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`
   - `evals/*.yaml`
3. Provide exactly one recommended next implementation task with measurable acceptance criteria.
