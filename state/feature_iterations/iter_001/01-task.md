# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as planning-only work for harness improvements in `state/`.
- No prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_XXX` folder exists, so this establishes the initial backlog and execution direction.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan that explicitly covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
- Identify concrete follow-on work touching `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Provide one actionable next task with clear acceptance criteria and expected files.
