# Iteration Summary

This seed iteration established the first feature-improvement backlog entry under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
The selected task was planning-only: define how to improve custom harness features, tests, and eval coverage.
The plan identifies concrete future edits across `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
Validation confirmed prompt/guideline inputs were read and that all seven required artifacts were created.
No harness runtime code changed in this iteration by design, reducing risk while creating an actionable next step.
The next iteration is scoped to one small behavior slice: deterministic trace-summary normalization plus smoke/eval coverage.
