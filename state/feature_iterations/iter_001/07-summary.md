# Iteration Summary

This seed iteration executed the planning-only contract from `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.
A new iteration folder (`state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`) was created with all seven required artifacts.
The selected task defined a concrete harness-improvement story and acceptance criteria.
The plan outlines future work across `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
Validation documented prompt/development-guideline review and artifact completeness checks.
Risks and trade-offs were captured to keep follow-up implementation iterations constrained and deterministic.
A single next task was recommended: implement deterministic trace checkpoint summaries plus smoke verification.
