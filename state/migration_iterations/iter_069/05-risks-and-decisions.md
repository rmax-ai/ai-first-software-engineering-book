# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Historical iteration artifacts still include legacy `python` snippets in narrative or evidence contexts, so stale snippet phrasing can continue to appear in future handoffs.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Followed `iter_068` guidance exactly and limited scope to one line in `iter_066/04-validation.md`.
- Avoided broader multi-file historical cleanup in this iteration to preserve the one-task execution rule.

## Intentionally deferred
- Additional snippet normalizations outside `iter_066/04-validation.md` were deferred to the next single-file iteration.
