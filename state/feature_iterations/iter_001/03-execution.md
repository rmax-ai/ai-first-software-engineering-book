# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- Read `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.
- Read `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- Enumerated `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` folders (none found; created `iter_001`).
- Wrote iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.

## Rationale
This seed iteration is planning-only per prompt requirements, producing the backlog and handoff structure without implementing harness code.
