# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Historical migration artifacts may still contain other escaped legacy snippet mentions outside this scoped task.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Followed prior iteration guidance exactly and changed only the designated line.
- Kept scope minimal to reduce risk and preserve auditability.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Broader normalization across older iteration artifacts is deferred to future single-task iterations.
