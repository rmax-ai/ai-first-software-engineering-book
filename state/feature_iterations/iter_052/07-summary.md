# Summary

This iteration executed one backlog task from `iter_051/06-next-iteration.md`.
A new 22-suffix deterministic duplicate-count coverage guard mode was added in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
The new mode was registered in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS`, which keeps parser choices and usage examples in sync.
Targeted smoke verification was run for both global mode choice coverage and the new guard mode.
Both commands passed with explicit PASS output.
Iteration artifacts were written under `state/feature_iterations/iter_052/` following the seven-file contract.
A single concrete next task was proposed for the 23-suffix follow-up guard in `iter_053`.
