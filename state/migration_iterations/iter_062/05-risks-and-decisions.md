# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Low risk: one-line historical documentation normalization.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Followed `iter_061/06-next-iteration.md` exactly and limited scope to one unfinished task.
- Avoided any adjacent doc refactors to keep auditability high.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Live smoke execution and dependency-install work remains deferred to the next iteration.
