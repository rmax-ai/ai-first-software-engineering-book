# Summary

This iteration executed the single next task from `iter_045`.
I added the 16-suffix duplicate-count mode-coverage guard handler in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
I registered the same mode in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` so argparse choices and generated usage examples include it.
Targeted validation ran with `mode-choices-coverage-guard` and the new long mode, and both checks passed.
Only the required smoke-test surface and iteration-046 artifacts were changed.
A single concrete next task is defined for `iter_047` to continue deterministic coverage progression.
