# Execution log

## Commands/tools run
- Read prompt contract: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.
- Read harness development guidance: `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- Discovered iteration base: no existing `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` folders.
- Created folder: `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
- Wrote required artifacts `01-task.md` through `07-summary.md`.

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- This seed iteration is intentionally planning-only to satisfy the prompt's stop condition and establish a concrete, testable backlog for subsequent implementation work.
