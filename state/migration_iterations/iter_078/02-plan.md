# Plan

1. Confirm the handed-off legacy snippet exists in `state/migration_iterations/iter_076/01-task.md`.
2. Apply a one-line wording normalization to `uv run python`.
3. Run focused `rg` checks and inspect scoped git evidence.
4. Record execution, validation, risks/decisions, next task, and summary artifacts for this iteration.
