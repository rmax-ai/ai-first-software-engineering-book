# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- This is the seed feature iteration and establishes the actionable backlog for subsequent implementation work.
- A written plan is needed first so later changes to `state/` stay scoped, testable, and aligned with `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
- Explicitly map intended work to these paths: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Define one concrete next implementation task with verifiable acceptance criteria.
