# Plan

1. Confirm the remaining escaped `python` fallback-error snippet in `state/migration_iterations/iter_083/03-execution.md`.
2. Apply the smallest one-line edit to normalize it to escaped `uv run python` wording.
3. Run targeted verification commands (`rg`, `git diff`) on the changed file.
4. Record execution, validation, risks, next task, and summary in `state/migration_iterations/iter_086/` artifacts.
