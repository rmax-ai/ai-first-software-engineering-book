# Summary

Completed one bounded backlog task from the prior iteration handoff.
Added `usage-examples-duplicate-count-wrapper-helper-uniqueness-order-adjacency-order-uniqueness-adjacency-guard` to enforce immediate adjacency from the uniqueness guard to `usage-examples-order-guard`.
Registered the new mode with deterministic description text in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS`.
Executed the targeted smoke command for the new mode and captured a PASS result.
Produced all seven required iteration artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_110/`.
Kept the diff minimal with no unrelated refactors.
