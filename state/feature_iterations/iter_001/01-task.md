# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- This is the seed iteration from `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.
- A concrete backlog is needed before implementation-focused iterations can proceed safely.

## Acceptance criteria
- Document a concise improvement plan spanning features, tests, and evals.
- Include explicit follow-on steps for `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Produce complete iteration artifacts (`01` through `07`) with verifiable references.
