# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as a planning-only pass.
- A concrete plan is needed before touching harness runtime code in `state/` and eval contracts in `evals/`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan that covers feature improvements for the harness, targeted tests, and regression eval coverage.
- Explicitly map planned work to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and relevant `evals/*.yaml`.
- Leave exactly one recommended next task with concrete acceptance criteria.
