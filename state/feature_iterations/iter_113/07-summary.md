# Summary

This iteration executed one backlog task from `iter_112/06-next-iteration.md`.
A new smoke mode now guards ordering from `usage-examples-order-guard` to the newest uniqueness-adjacency guard mode.
`state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` gained `run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_wrapper_helper_uniqueness_order_adjacency_order_uniqueness_adjacency_uniqueness_adjacency_order_guard_mode`.
`TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` now registers `usage-examples-duplicate-count-wrapper-helper-uniqueness-order-adjacency-order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-order-guard` with deterministic text.
Targeted validation ran with `uv run python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py --mode usage-examples-duplicate-count-wrapper-helper-uniqueness-order-adjacency-order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-order-guard`.
Validation output was PASS with exit code 0.
All seven required markdown artifacts were written to `state/feature_iterations/iter_113/`.
One concrete next task was proposed for the subsequent iteration.
