# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
The seed iteration should establish a clear, testable backlog for improving the `state/` harness before implementation work begins.

## Acceptance criteria
- A concise plan identifies harness feature improvements across observability, role I/O scaffolding, and deterministic controls.
- The plan maps targeted tests for each proposed improvement.
- The plan ties improvements to concrete eval/regression signals under `evals/` and harness metrics outputs.
