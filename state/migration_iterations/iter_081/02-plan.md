# Plan

1. Capture pre-edit evidence in `state/migration_iterations/iter_079/01-task.md` for the escaped fallback-error command snippet.
2. Apply a one-line edit in `state/migration_iterations/iter_079/01-task.md` to normalize wording to `uv run python`.
3. Run targeted validation (`rg` and scoped `git diff`) and record outcomes.
4. Write iteration artifacts under `state/migration_iterations/iter_081/` and provide one concrete next task.
