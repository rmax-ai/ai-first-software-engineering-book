# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Historical migration artifacts contain many intentional mentions of legacy commands; broad replacements could corrupt evidence context.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Performed a targeted one-line edit in only `state/migration_iterations/iter_079/01-task.md` to minimize churn and preserve historical records.
- Followed the prior iteration handoff exactly to avoid scope creep.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Deferred other legacy snippet mentions outside the handed-off smallest task.
