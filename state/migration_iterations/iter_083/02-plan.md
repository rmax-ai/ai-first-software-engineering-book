# Plan

1. Capture pre-edit evidence from `HEAD^` for the escaped legacy fallback-error wording in `state/migration_iterations/iter_081/01-task.md`.
2. Apply a single-line wording update in that file to use `uv run python`.
3. Run targeted `rg` and scoped diff validation commands.
4. Record execution, validation, risks, and next-step handoff artifacts for this iteration.
