# Validation

## Verification performed
- Confirmed the seed prompt requirements were reflected in artifacts:
  - planning-only scope
  - explicit coverage of features/tests/evals
  - concrete next task with acceptance criteria and file targets
- Confirmed all seven required files exist under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.

## Observed results
- Iteration folder contract satisfied (`01-task.md` through `07-summary.md` present).
- Content aligns with `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` seed-iteration constraints.

## Acceptance criteria status
- ✅ Plan covers features/tests/evals.
- ✅ Follow-up sequence and expected files are explicit.
- ✅ No implementation changes made in this planning iteration.
