# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
This is the seed feature iteration and establishes the actionable backlog for future harness improvements. A concrete plan is needed before implementation so later iterations can deliver focused, verifiable deltas in `state/` and `evals/`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Document planned harness **features** with explicit target files.
- Document planned **tests** that validate each proposed behavior.
- Document planned **evaluations** and expected regression signals.
- Keep scope to planning only; no harness implementation changes.
