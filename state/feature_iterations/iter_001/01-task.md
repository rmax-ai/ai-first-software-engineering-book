# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_XXX` backlog exists, so the seed iteration must establish an actionable harness improvement plan before implementation work starts.

## Acceptance criteria
- Document a concise backlog that explicitly covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **evals**.
- Define a future execution path touching `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Record validation evidence that the plan is consistent with `DEVELOPMENT.md` and current repository structure.
