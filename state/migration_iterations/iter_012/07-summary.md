# Summary

This iteration attempted the remaining live-provider smoke coverage area.
The non-mock provider attempts were executed and produced clear blocked evidence.
`copilot` is blocked by missing `COPILOT_API_KEY`.
`copilot` is blocked by connection refusal on local runtime.
No code changes were needed or made.
The migration stream now has explicit evidence for all feasible in-repo tasks.
Remaining unfinished items are integration checks requiring environment/governance unblocking.
Next iteration should proceed only after those prerequisites are satisfied.
