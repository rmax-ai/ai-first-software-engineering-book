# Summary

Completed one focused maintainability task from `iter_075` guidance.
Added `_mode_action_for_parser` in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
Updated parity cleanup mode-choice guard functions to use the shared helper.
Kept behavior and assertion messages stable while removing repeated parser lookup blocks.
Executed required smoke validations for adjacency guard and mode-choices coverage.
Both validation commands passed.
Documented execution, risks, and follow-up in `state/feature_iterations/iter_076/`.
Recommended extending helper adoption to remaining coverage guard functions next.
