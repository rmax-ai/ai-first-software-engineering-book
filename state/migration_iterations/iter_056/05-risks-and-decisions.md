# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Remaining historical bare `python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` snippets may still exist in other iteration folders.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Followed prior handoff strictly and changed only the single requested snippet to keep risk and diff size minimal.
- Used focused textual validation instead of broader suite execution because this iteration was a documentation-only normalization.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Repository-wide sweep of all remaining bare smoke command snippets was deferred to a future single-task iteration.
