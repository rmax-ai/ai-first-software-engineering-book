# Iteration 001 plan

1. Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` and the incremental execution contract to anchor scope.
2. Define a harness-improvement backlog that is implementation-ready but minimal.
3. Break later work into focused tracks:
   - `state/kernel.py`: add deterministic observability and execution controls.
   - `state/role_io_templates.py`: clarify role I/O scaffold behavior and traceability.
   - `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`: expand smoke coverage for new harness controls.
   - `evals/*.yaml`: align regression gates with new observable signals.
4. Capture risks/trade-offs and defer implementation to future iterations.
5. Recommend exactly one next task that starts with the smallest kernel observability slice.
