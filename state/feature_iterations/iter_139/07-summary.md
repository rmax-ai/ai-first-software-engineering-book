# Summary

This iteration completed one backlog task from `state/feature_iterations/iter_138/06-next-iteration.md`.
It added uniqueness-count smoke coverage for the long-form `...uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-guard` mode.
`state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` now includes a new `...-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-guard` runner that asserts the new adjacency-order mode appears exactly once.
`TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` now registers a runnable smoke mode for that new uniqueness-count assertion.
Targeted validation passed with `uv run python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py --mode <new-mode>`.
All seven required iteration artifacts were created under `state/feature_iterations/iter_139/`.
The diff remained scoped to one code file and the new iteration handoff markdown files.
