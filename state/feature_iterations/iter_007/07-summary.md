# Summary

Executed one backlog task from `iter_006` by adding malformed metrics-container guard coverage.
Implemented deterministic `trace-summary-container-shape-guard` mode in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
Wired the mode through usage documentation, CLI choices, and dispatcher logic.
Validated existing `trace-summary` and `trace-summary-shape-guard` paths remained stable.
Ran targeted compile validation to confirm no syntax regressions.
All acceptance criteria for this iteration were met with minimal, isolated edits.
No unrelated refactors were introduced.
Next iteration should add one deterministic malformed `history` container-shape guard mode.
