# Plan

1. Define the planning scope from `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
2. Break harness improvements into three streams:
   - Features in `state/kernel.py` and `state/role_io_templates.py`
   - Test coverage in `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py` (plus targeted harness tests)
   - Regression signals in `evals/*.yaml` and metrics expectations
3. Convert those streams into a backlog-ready next step that is small enough for one iteration.

## Expected files to change this iteration

- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
