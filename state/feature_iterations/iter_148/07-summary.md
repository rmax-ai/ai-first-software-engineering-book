# Summary

This iteration executed one smallest unfinished task from `iter_147` guidance.
One dedicated adjacency-order smoke runner was added for the newest long-form exact-once mode pairing.
`TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` now includes a mode entry for that new adjacency assertion.
No broad refactors were introduced; changes were limited to one smoke test file plus iteration artifacts.
Targeted smoke validation was run and passed for the new mode, and a related existing sequence guard was re-validated.
All required iteration artifacts were added under `state/feature_iterations/iter_148/`.
A single next task was documented for the following iteration.
