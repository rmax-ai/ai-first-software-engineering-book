# Plan

1. Confirm the current escaped fallback-error snippet wording in `state/migration_iterations/iter_083/04-validation.md`.
2. Apply a minimal one-line wording normalization to use escaped `uv run python`.
3. Run targeted `rg` and `git --no-pager diff` validation commands.
4. Record execution, validation, risks/decisions, next task recommendation, and summary.
