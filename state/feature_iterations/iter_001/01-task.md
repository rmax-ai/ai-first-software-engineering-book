# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now

No prior `state/feature_iterations/` task exists, so a seed backlog is required before implementation iterations can proceed in a controlled way.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Produce a concise harness-improvement plan that explicitly covers feature additions, targeted tests, and regression evaluations.
2. Scope the plan to concrete files likely to change: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
3. Define one smallest next implementation task with measurable acceptance criteria for the following iteration.
