# Iteration summary

This seed iteration completed one planning task: defining the custom harness improvement backlog.
The output follows the required seven-artifact contract under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
The plan explicitly covers feature targets in `state/kernel.py` and `state/role_io_templates.py`.
It also defines test direction for `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py` and regression gating expectations in `evals/`.
No harness implementation files were modified in this iteration.
Validation focused on artifact completeness and explicit path coverage.
The next iteration is scoped to one concrete implementation slice: deterministic trace-summary observability.
