# Execution log

## Commands/tools run
- Read prompt contract: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.
- Read harness guidance: `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- Discovered next iteration folder under `state/feature_iterations/` and initialized `iter_001`.
- Authored iteration artifacts `01-task.md` through `07-summary.md`.

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale per change
- Created the required seven-artifact handoff bundle with planning-only scope per seed iteration rules.
- Captured concrete follow-up backlog guidance so the next iteration can execute a smallest implementation slice.
