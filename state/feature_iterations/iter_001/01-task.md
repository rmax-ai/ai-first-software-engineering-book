# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
The feature-iteration track is starting and needs a concrete backlog before implementation work can proceed safely.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan that covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval** regression gates.
- Define at least one concrete follow-up task with clear acceptance criteria.
- Keep this iteration planning-only (no production code changes).
