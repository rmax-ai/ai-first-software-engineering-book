# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Additional historical iteration docs still include bare `python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py ...` snippets.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Followed the prior handoff exactly and changed only one line in one historical file to keep scope minimal and reviewable.
- Used focused text checks and git show evidence because this iteration was a documentation-only normalization.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Broader cleanup of remaining bare snippets is deferred to subsequent one-task iterations.
