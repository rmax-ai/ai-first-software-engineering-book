# Iteration Summary

This iteration established the first feature-improvement artifact set in `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
The selected task was planning custom harness improvements, per prompt seed guidance.
The resulting plan is implementation-ready and explicitly covers feature enhancements, test strategy, and eval alignment.
Future work is mapped to concrete files across `state/` and `evals/`.
A single next task was defined to keep follow-up scope small and deterministic.
No production code was modified in this planning iteration.
Validation confirms all seven required artifacts exist and are populated.
