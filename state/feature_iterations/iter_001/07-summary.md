# Iteration Summary

- Initialized `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` as the first feature improvement iteration.
- Executed the seed task as planning-only, per prompt contract.
- Produced a focused backlog spanning harness features, tests, and eval surfaces.
- Mapped future implementation targets to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Captured execution and validation evidence from prompt/governance review and iteration discovery.
- Recorded risks and explicit deferrals to avoid accidental scope expansion.
- Defined exactly one next task: implement deterministic kernel trace logging with smoke validation.
