# Plan

1. Inspect the latest uniqueness-adjacency guard functions and registrations in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
2. Add one adjacency-order guard function that asserts newest `...order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-guard` is immediately before prior `...order-uniqueness-adjacency-guard` in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS`.
3. Register a new `...order-uniqueness-adjacency-uniqueness-adjacency-order-guard` mode in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` with deterministic wording, and order entries to satisfy the adjacency contract.
4. Run the targeted smoke mode command and record evidence.
5. Write all seven required artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_128/`.
