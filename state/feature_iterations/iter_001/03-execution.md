# Execution log

## Commands/tools run
- `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- `view DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*`
- `glob state/kernel.py state/role_io_templates.py state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py evals/*.yaml`
- Created iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md` — set iteration scope and acceptance criteria.
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md` — defined implementation-ready backlog structure.
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md` — recorded execution evidence.
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md` — to capture verification evidence for this planning iteration.
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md` — to record deferrals/trade-offs.
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md` — to provide one next task.
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md` — to provide executive summary.

## Rationale
This seed iteration intentionally produces a concrete, testable implementation backlog without changing harness runtime code.
