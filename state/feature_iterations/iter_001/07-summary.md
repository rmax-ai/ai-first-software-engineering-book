# Iteration Summary

This seed iteration completed the required planning-first pass for harness improvements.
It established a concise backlog focused on features, tests, and eval regression gates.
The plan explicitly scopes future work to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`,
`state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
No production code was modified in this iteration by design.
All seven required artifacts were created under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
Validation confirmed artifact completeness and required file-path coverage in the plan.
The next iteration is narrowed to deterministic trace-summary telemetry expansion.
