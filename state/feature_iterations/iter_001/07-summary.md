# Iteration summary

This seed iteration completed one planning task: defining the custom state harness improvement backlog.
It created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` and all seven required markdown artifacts.
The plan explicitly covers future feature work in kernel observability and role I/O scaffolding.
It also defines targeted smoke test expansion and eval-gate updates for regression detection.
No harness implementation code was changed; scope remained planning-only by design.
Validation confirmed artifact completeness and required topic coverage.
The next iteration is narrowly scoped to implementing kernel phase-trace observability primitives.
