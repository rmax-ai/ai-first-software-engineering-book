# Summary

- Executed one backlog task from `iter_131/06-next-iteration.md`.
- Added a new smoke guard function that asserts `...order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-guard` is immediately followed by `...order-uniqueness-order-guard`.
- Registered one new mode: `...order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-guard`.
- Fixed registration placement so adjacency semantics hold.
- Ran the targeted smoke command and captured PASS output.
- Kept changes minimal and localized to the smoke test plus the new `iter_132` artifacts.
- Recorded risks, decisions, and a single concrete next task for `iter_133`.
