# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior `state/feature_iterations/` handoff exists, so this seed iteration establishes the actionable improvement backlog for the custom harness in `state/` and aligns future work to `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Provide concise feature improvements for `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, and `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`.
- Define targeted tests/verification commands for each planned change.
- Map each planned change to regression-detection eval coverage in `evals/*.yaml` and harness metrics outputs.
- Produce a single recommended next iteration task with concrete acceptance criteria and expected touched files.
