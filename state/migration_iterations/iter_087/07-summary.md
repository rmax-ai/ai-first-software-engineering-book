# Summary

Created iteration `iter_087` and completed one scoped migration-artifact normalization task.
The update changed escaped fallback-error snippet wording in `state/migration_iterations/iter_083/04-validation.md`.
Only one line changed in the historical target artifact.
All seven required `iter_087` markdown handoff artifacts were added.
Validation was scoped to targeted `rg` and `git --no-pager diff` checks.
No runtime code paths, interfaces, or behavior were modified.
Risk remains limited to similar escaped legacy snippets in nearby historical artifacts.
The next iteration recommendation keeps cleanup incremental and auditable.
