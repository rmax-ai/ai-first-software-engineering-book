# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
This is the required seed iteration from `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.  
We need a concrete backlog before changing `state/` so future iterations can execute one minimal improvement at a time with measurable outcomes.

## Acceptance criteria
1. Plan explicitly covers **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks** for the custom harness.
2. Plan identifies concrete future touch points: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
3. Iteration artifacts are complete and actionable for the next single implementation task.
