# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Low risk: this is a one-line historical documentation normalization.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Kept scope to exactly one unfinished task from `iter_060/06-next-iteration.md`.
- Avoided touching adjacent files to minimize churn and preserve auditability.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Remaining historical command normalization beyond this single line was deferred to the next iteration.
