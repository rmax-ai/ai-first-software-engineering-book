# Iteration Summary

- Created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` as the first feature-improvement iteration folder.
- Executed a planning-only task: **Plan custom state harness improvements**.
- Defined a concise backlog framing required harness features, test surfaces, and eval/regression checkpoints.
- Captured execution evidence and validation steps with explicit file paths and commands.
- Logged risks around plan drift and eval/metric coupling, with intentional deferral of implementation edits.
- Produced one concrete next task targeting deterministic trace-summary observability and smoke verification.
