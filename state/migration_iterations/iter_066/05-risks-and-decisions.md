# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- This cleanup modifies historical iteration artifacts; wording changes must stay narrowly scoped to avoid rewriting prior intent.

## Decisions made
- Applied only the minimum one-line normalization in `state/migration_iterations/iter_055/06-next-iteration.md`.
- Kept all behavior and code paths unchanged because this task is documentation/handoff normalization only.

## Deferred
- Broader normalization of older historical markdown references was deferred to future single-task iterations.
