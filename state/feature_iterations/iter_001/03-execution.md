# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- Read prompt contract: `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read harness development guidance: `view DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Checked existing iteration folders: `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*`
- Created seed iteration artifacts under: `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
This seed iteration intentionally performs planning-only work per the prompt contract, producing a concrete backlog for subsequent implementation iterations.
