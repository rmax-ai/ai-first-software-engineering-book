# Iteration Summary

This seed run executed one planning task: define the custom harness improvement backlog.
A new iteration folder was created at `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
All seven required markdown artifacts were authored.
The plan explicitly covers feature work, test strategy, and evaluation mapping.
Planned feature touchpoints include `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, and `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`.
Planned evaluation touchpoints include `evals/chapter-quality.yaml`, `evals/style-guard.yaml`, and `evals/drift-detection.yaml`.
No runtime code was changed in this iteration.
Validation confirmed artifact completeness and alignment with seed-iteration requirements.
A single concrete next task was queued for trace summary scaffolding in `state/kernel.py`.
