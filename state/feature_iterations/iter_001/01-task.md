# Task

## Selected task title
Plan custom state harness improvements.

## Why this task now
No feature iteration backlog exists yet, and `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` specifies a seed iteration that creates an actionable plan before implementation work starts.

## Acceptance criteria
- Defines a concise backlog covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
- References future implementation surfaces: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Leaves exactly one concrete next task in `06-next-iteration.md`.
