# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
`state/feature_iterations/` has no prior iterations, and `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` specifies a seed iteration focused on planning the harness backlog.

## Acceptance criteria
- Define concise harness improvement scope covering features, tests, and eval signals.
- Produce a concrete next-iteration-ready plan with explicit file paths.
- Keep this iteration planning-only with no harness code edits.
