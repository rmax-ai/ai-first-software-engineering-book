# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior `state/feature_iterations/` backlog exists, so the first iteration must establish a concrete, reviewable roadmap before implementation work begins.

## Acceptance criteria
- Define a concise harness-improvement story that explicitly covers features, tests, and eval regression detection.
- Scope later work to targeted files: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Produce exactly one recommended next task with concrete, verifiable criteria.
