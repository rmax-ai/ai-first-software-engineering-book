# Summary

This iteration executed one task from `iter_123/06-next-iteration.md`.
A new adjacency-order smoke guard mode was added for the newest uniqueness guard registration ordering.
The new mode was registered in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` with deterministic description text.
Targeted validation was run for the new mode and it returned PASS.
No public interfaces changed.
All seven required markdown artifacts were written in `state/feature_iterations/iter_124/`.
The next iteration recommends adding a uniqueness-count guard for the new adjacency-order mode.
