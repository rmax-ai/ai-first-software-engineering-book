# Plan

1. Read `DEVELOPMENT.md` and previous iteration handoff in `state/feature_iterations/iter_044/06-next-iteration.md`.
2. Extend `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` by adding one new deterministic duplicate-count mode coverage guard function for the 15-suffix mode chain.
3. Add a matching entry to `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` so argparse mode choices and generated usage examples include the new mode.
4. Run only the targeted smoke checks requested by acceptance criteria.
5. Record execution evidence, validation outcomes, risks/decisions, and next recommendation in iteration artifacts.
