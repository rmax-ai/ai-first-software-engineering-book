# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Minimal risk: only historical migration artifacts were edited; runtime code paths were untouched.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Kept scope to a one-line wording normalization in `iter_092/01-task.md` to maintain smallest-task cadence.
- Used targeted validation only, trading broad test coverage for strict minimal-diff evidence aligned to the task.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Deferred the next adjacent acceptance-criteria wording normalization to the following iteration.
