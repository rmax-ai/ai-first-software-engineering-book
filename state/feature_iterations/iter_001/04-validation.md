# Validation

## Verification performed
- Reviewed `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` and confirmed this iteration is planning-only.
- Reviewed `DEVELOPMENT.md` and aligned planned touchpoints with harness guidance (`state/kernel.py`, role templates, smoke, evals).
- Confirmed iteration discovery rule application: no prior `iter_XXX` found, so this run uses `iter_001`.

## Results
- All seven required artifacts were created for `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
- Acceptance criteria in `01-task.md` are met by the planning scope documented in `02-plan.md` and `06-next-iteration.md`.

## Acceptance criteria status
- Plan covers features/tests/evals: **pass**
- Explicit file mapping for future code work: **pass**
- Exactly one next task recommendation: **pass**
