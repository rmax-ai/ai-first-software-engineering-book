# Summary

Implemented one smallest unfinished backlog item from `iter_046` guidance.  
Added a new deterministic duplicate-count mode coverage guard for the 17-suffix mode name in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.  
Registered the mode in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` so parser choices and generated usage examples include it.  
Ran the two required targeted validation commands and both passed.  
Documented execution evidence, risks, and a single next task for iter_048.  
Scope was intentionally limited to this one guard extension with no unrelated refactors.
