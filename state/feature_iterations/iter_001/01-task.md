# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now

`prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as a planning-only pass that creates a concrete backlog for the custom harness under `state/`.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Produce a concise improvement plan that explicitly covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
2. Map the plan to concrete files, including `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
3. Do not implement code changes in this iteration; only produce planning artifacts and verification evidence.
