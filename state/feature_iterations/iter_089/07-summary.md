# Summary

This iteration completed one bounded duplicate-count coverage-guard deduplication task.
Two additional wrapper functions were migrated to `_run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard(...)`.
The migrated wrappers correspond to the 19-guard and 20-guard variants.
Wrapper names, mode names, and PASS strings were preserved.
Both required smoke commands were executed and passed.
All seven required iteration artifacts were created under `state/feature_iterations/iter_089/`.
The next iteration continues the same two-wrapper cadence for minimal-risk rollout.
