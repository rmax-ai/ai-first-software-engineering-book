# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- This is the first feature iteration and establishes the execution backlog for future implementation work.
- A written plan is required before touching harness behavior so future diffs stay minimal and verifiable.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan that covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks**.
- Reference concrete files for future implementation (`state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, `evals/*.yaml`).
- Define exactly one next implementation task with clear, testable acceptance criteria.
