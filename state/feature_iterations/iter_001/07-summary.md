# Iteration summary

This seed feature iteration established the first backlog entry under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
The task was intentionally planning-only, as required by the incremental execution prompt.
The artifacts now define a concrete roadmap spanning harness features, test strategy, and eval alignment.
Future work is explicitly scoped to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
Validation criteria were documented so plan quality is reviewable and reproducible.
A single next task was selected to begin implementation with deterministic trace-summary instrumentation.
The handoff is complete and ready for the next autonomous iteration.
