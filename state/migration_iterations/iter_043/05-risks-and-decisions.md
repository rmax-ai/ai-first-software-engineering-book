# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- No new functional risks observed after the full deterministic non-live mode matrix passed.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Added a full deterministic non-live matrix run after targeted checks to increase confidence in shutdown hardening coverage.

## Deferred items
- Live provider smoke verification remains deferred because this iteration focused on deterministic shutdown behavior.
