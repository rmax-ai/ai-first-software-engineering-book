# Summary

This iteration executed one backlog task from `iter_119/06-next-iteration.md`.
A new smoke guard mode was added to assert the latest adjacency guard mode appears exactly once in `TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS`.
The mode was registered with deterministic description text in the trace-summary mode sequence.
No unrelated logic or interfaces were changed.
Targeted verification ran with the new mode and returned PASS with exit code 0.
All seven required artifacts for `iter_120` were written in `state/feature_iterations/iter_120/`.
The next iteration recommends adjacency hardening for the newly added uniqueness mode.
