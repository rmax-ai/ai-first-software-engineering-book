# Validation

## Verification performed
- Reviewed the generated plan artifacts against the required seven-file folder contract.
- Cross-checked plan scope against `DEVELOPMENT.md` guidance for UV usage, harness modules, and eval contracts.
- Confirmed the plan explicitly covers features, tests, and evaluations requested by the seed iteration prompt.

## Results
- Folder contract: **PASS** (`01-task.md` through `07-summary.md` present).
- Feature/test/eval plan coverage: **PASS** (explicit sections and file paths included).
- Planning-only scope preserved: **PASS** (no harness implementation changes in this iteration).
