# Iteration Summary

This iteration completed the required seed planning task for incremental improvements.
I created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` and wrote all seven required artifacts.
The task definition and plan explicitly cover harness features, tests, and eval pathways.
No harness code changed in this iteration by design; scope stayed planning-only.
Validation confirmed artifact completeness and explicit plan coverage for feature/test/eval content.
Risks and deferrals were documented for transparency and controlled follow-up.
The next iteration is scoped to one minimal implementation task in `state/kernel.py` with smoke validation.
