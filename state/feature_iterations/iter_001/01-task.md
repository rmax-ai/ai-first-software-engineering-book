# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
This repository has no prior `state/feature_iterations/` execution artifacts, so a seed planning iteration is needed to define the first actionable harness backlog with clear verification expectations.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan that scopes harness improvements across features, tests, and eval coverage.
- Identify concrete follow-on work touching `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Capture one next iteration task with explicit acceptance criteria and expected files.
