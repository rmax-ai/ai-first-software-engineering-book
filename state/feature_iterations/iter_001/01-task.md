# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_XXX` backlog exists, and the execution prompt requires a seed planning iteration that establishes the improvement roadmap for the custom harness.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan covering harness features, tests, and evaluation gates.
- Identify concrete future work touching `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Leave exactly one recommended next task with actionable acceptance criteria.
