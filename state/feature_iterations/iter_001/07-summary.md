# Iteration summary

This iteration created the initial feature-improvement handoff under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
It followed the seed requirement to focus on planning custom harness upgrades rather than implementation.
The task and plan define concrete workstreams for features, tests, and eval integration.
Feature scope is anchored to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, and `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`.
Evaluation scope is tied to `evals/chapter-quality.yaml`, `evals/style-guard.yaml`, and `evals/drift-detection.yaml`.
Validation captured discovery evidence, guideline alignment, and file-existence checks.
Risks and deferrals were documented to keep future execution bounded and predictable.
A single next task was provided: implement deterministic trace-summary guardrails with smoke coverage.
