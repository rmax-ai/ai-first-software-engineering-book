# Plan

1. Confirm the handed-off fallback-error snippet still uses bare `python` in `state/migration_iterations/iter_021/06-next-iteration.md`.
2. Apply a one-line markdown edit to switch it to `uv run python`.
3. Run targeted `rg` checks for presence/absence and capture `git diff` evidence.
4. Write the seven required iteration artifacts with concise outcomes.
