# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior `state/feature_iterations/` backlog exists, so the first iteration must establish a concrete, ordered plan that future iterations can execute with minimal ambiguity.

## Acceptance criteria
- Defines prioritized harness feature improvements covering observability, role-IO scaffolds, and deterministic controls.
- Defines targeted tests to validate each planned feature using existing harness entry points.
- Defines evaluation/regression mapping to existing `evals/*.yaml` and `state/metrics.json` signals.
- Stays planning-only with no production code modifications.
