# Summary

Executed one backlog task from `iter_007` by adding deterministic malformed `history` container guard coverage.
Implemented `trace-summary-history-container-shape-guard` in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
Wired the mode through usage text, CLI choices, and dispatcher routing.
Validated the new mode and confirmed neighboring trace-summary modes remain green.
Ran compile validation to confirm no syntax regression.
All acceptance criteria were met with minimal, isolated edits.
No unrelated refactors were introduced.
