# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- `view prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- `view DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*`
- `apply_patch` to create iteration artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- Created the seed planning iteration exactly as requested by the prompt.
- Kept scope to a single task: plan backlog, no harness code implementation.
