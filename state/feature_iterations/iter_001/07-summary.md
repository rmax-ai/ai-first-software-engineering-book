# Summary

This iteration initialized the feature-improvement workflow by creating `iter_001`.
It selected one planning task: define custom harness improvements for `state/`.
The resulting plan covers feature priorities in `state/kernel.py` and role-I/O contracts.
It also defines verification strategy through smoke modes in `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`.
Eval alignment was mapped to existing `evals/*.yaml` contracts for regression detection.
No runtime implementation changes were made in this iteration by design.
All seven required markdown artifacts were created and validated as present/non-empty.
The next iteration is narrowed to deterministic trace-summary implementation plus smoke evidence.
