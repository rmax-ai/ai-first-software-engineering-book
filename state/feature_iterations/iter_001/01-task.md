# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior `state/feature_iterations/` backlog exists, so the first iteration must establish a concrete, verifiable plan for harness improvements before code changes.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise backlog plan covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression** strategy.
- Identify concrete target files, including `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Define one next executable implementation task with testable outcomes.
