# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- This is the required seed iteration from `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.
- A focused plan is needed before touching harness logic in `state/` so later implementation iterations stay deterministic and testable.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise backlog that covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks**.
- Reference concrete target paths, including `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and relevant `evals/*.yaml`.
- Define exactly one next implementation task with verifiable outcomes.
