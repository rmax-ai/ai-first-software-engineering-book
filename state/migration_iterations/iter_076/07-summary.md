# Summary

Iteration 076 completed one minimal migration artifact cleanup task.
The selected task came directly from the prior iteration handoff in `iter_075/06-next-iteration.md`.
A single acceptance-criteria line in `state/migration_iterations/iter_074/01-task.md` was normalized from escaped bare `python` wording to escaped `uv run python` wording.
No runtime code, interfaces, or behavior were changed.
Focused `rg` checks and scoped diff evidence validated the update.
All seven required iteration artifacts were created under `state/migration_iterations/iter_076/`.
The next iteration continues the same narrow command-text normalization stream in `iter_073/01-task.md`.
