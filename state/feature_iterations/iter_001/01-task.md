# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- This is the seed iteration defined by `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`.
- A concrete plan is required before implementation iterations can safely change harness behavior.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise backlog plan that covers features, tests, and eval signals for the harness.
- Explicitly map future work to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Keep this iteration planning-only (no runtime behavior changes).
