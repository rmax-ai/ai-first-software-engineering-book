# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as a planning pass.
- A clear backlog is needed before touching harness code in `state/` and eval contracts in `evals/`.

## Acceptance criteria
1. Produce a concise improvement plan covering features, tests, and evals for the custom harness.
2. Identify concrete follow-up work touching `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
3. Record verification evidence that the plan aligns with repository development guidance.
