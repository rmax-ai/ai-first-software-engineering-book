# Iteration summary

This iteration created the initial feature-improvement artifact set at `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.  
The selected task was the required seed activity: plan custom harness improvements rather than implement code.  
The plan defines future work across `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.  
It also specifies verification expectations using deterministic smoke modes and uv-run commands.  
Risks and trade-offs were documented to keep later iterations focused and regression-safe.  
A single concrete next task was proposed for `iter_002` with explicit acceptance criteria and file targets.  
No runtime harness logic was modified in this iteration.
