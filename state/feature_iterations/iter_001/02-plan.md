# Plan

1. Review `DEVELOPMENT.md` constraints and align proposed work to deterministic harness principles.
2. Define feature improvements for:
   - `state/kernel.py`: richer trace logging and deterministic execution controls.
   - `state/role_io_templates.py`: clearer role input/output scaffolds.
3. Define verification improvements for `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py` with explicit smoke scenarios tied to new controls.
4. Define eval updates in `evals/*.yaml` to detect regressions from new harness behavior and signals.
5. Sequence work into small future iterations with one immediately actionable next task.
