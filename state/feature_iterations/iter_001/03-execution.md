# Execution log

## Commands/tools run
- Read: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read: `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Discovery: glob `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (no prior iteration folders found)
- Create folder: `state/feature_iterations/iter_001`
- Wrote iteration artifacts: `01-task.md` through `07-summary.md`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- Produced the required seed planning artifacts to establish a concrete, verifiable backlog for harness improvements without implementing code changes.
