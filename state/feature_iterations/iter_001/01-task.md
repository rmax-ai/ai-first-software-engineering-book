# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as planning-only.
- A clear backlog is needed before implementing kernel/harness behavior changes.

## Acceptance criteria
- Produce a concise plan that covers required **features**, **tests**, and **evaluations**.
- Explicitly scope follow-up implementation to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Keep this iteration documentation-only with no runtime behavior changes.
