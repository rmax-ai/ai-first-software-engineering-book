# Plan

1. Confirm the target file still contains the legacy bare snippet reference.
2. Apply the smallest possible markdown edit in `state/migration_iterations/iter_065/06-next-iteration.md`.
3. Run targeted validation commands (`rg`, `git diff`/`git show`).
4. Record execution/validation evidence and handoff docs in `state/migration_iterations/iter_067/`.

## Files expected to change
- `state/migration_iterations/iter_065/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/migration_iterations/iter_067/01-task.md`
- `state/migration_iterations/iter_067/02-plan.md`
