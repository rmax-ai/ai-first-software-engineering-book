# Summary

This iteration completed one backlog task from `iter_135/06-next-iteration.md`.
It added a new adjacency-order guard runner for the newest long-form uniqueness-order mode.
`TRACE_SUMMARY_MODE_SPECS` now includes a corresponding `...uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-uniqueness-order-guard` mode.
The code change was constrained to `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py`.
Targeted validation ran with `uv run python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py --mode <new-mode>` and returned PASS.
Iteration evidence and handoff artifacts were written under `state/feature_iterations/iter_136/`.
No unrelated refactors were introduced.
