# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines the seed iteration as a planning pass.
- A concrete plan is needed before changing `state/kernel.py`, templates, and eval wiring.

## Acceptance criteria
1. Produce a concise backlog that covers harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression gates**.
2. Reference intended touchpoints: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
3. Define exactly one next implementation task with concrete acceptance criteria and expected files.
