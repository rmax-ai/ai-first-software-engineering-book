# Plan

## Step-by-step plan for this single task
1. Edit the single acceptance-criteria line in `state/migration_iterations/iter_070/01-task.md` to remove the bare `python` snippet wording.
2. Run focused `rg -nF` checks for old/new snippet text in the edited file.
3. Capture a scoped diff for the edited file.
4. Record this iteration's artifacts and handoff.
