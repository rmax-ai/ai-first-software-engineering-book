# Summary

This seed iteration completed the planning baseline required by the incremental improvements runner.  
I produced a focused task definition and a concrete backlog structure covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval protections**.  
The plan explicitly maps future implementation work to `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.  
No production harness code was changed in this iteration by design.  
Validation confirms all seven required artifacts exist and satisfy the prompt contract.  
The next iteration is constrained to one implementable improvement: deterministic phase-trace observability with smoke-test proof.
