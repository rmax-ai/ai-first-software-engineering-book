# Summary

Iteration 049 completed one scoped documentation migration task.
Recent historical artifact snippets in iterations 044–046 were normalized from bare `python` to `uv run python` for smoke-test commands.
Only command lines were edited in the selected `03-execution.md` and `04-validation.md` files.
No code logic or runtime behavior was changed.
Targeted diff review and ripgrep spot-checks verified the update.
All seven required iteration artifacts were created under `state/migration_iterations/iter_049/`.
Older historical iterations remain deferred for a future backfill pass.
