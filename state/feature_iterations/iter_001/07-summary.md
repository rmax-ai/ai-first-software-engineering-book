# Iteration summary

This iteration established the initial `state/feature_iterations/iter_001` backlog entry.
It followed the seed requirement to deliver a planning-only task for custom harness improvements.
The plan captures targeted feature work for kernel trace visibility and role scaffold clarity.
It also defines verification expectations through smoke coverage and deterministic checks.
Evaluation impact was mapped to existing eval contracts, including drift detection.
No harness runtime code was changed in this iteration by design.
A single, concrete next task now specifies schema validation implementation work.
