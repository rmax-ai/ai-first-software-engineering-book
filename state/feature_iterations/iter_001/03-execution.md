# Execution

## Commands/tools run
- Read:
  - `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
  - `.github/instructions/copilot-sdk-python.instructions.md`
  - `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Discovery:
  - checked `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (no prior iterations found)
- File operations:
  - created `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`
  - authored iteration artifacts `01` through `07`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- Established the seed backlog iteration requested by the execution prompt.
- Kept scope to one smallest unfinished task: planning only, no harness code edits.
