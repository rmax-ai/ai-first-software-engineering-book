# Iteration summary

This seed feature iteration established `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` as the first backlog handoff folder.  
The selected task was planning-only: define custom harness improvements before any implementation changes.  
Artifacts now capture features, tests, and eval alignment for upcoming work on `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, and `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`.  
Validation confirms the plan is grounded in `DEVELOPMENT.md` and existing eval contracts under `evals/*.yaml`.  
No runtime or product code behavior changed in this iteration.  
The next iteration is scoped to deterministic trace-summary observability plus smoke assertions.  
This keeps changes minimal, testable, and compatible with existing governance constraints.
