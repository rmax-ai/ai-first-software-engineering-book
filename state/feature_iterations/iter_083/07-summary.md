# Summary

This iteration executed the iter_082 recommended next task.
Exactly two additional duplicate-count coverage-guard wrappers were migrated to `_run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard(...)`.
Wrapper-specific PASS output strings were preserved unchanged.
Both required smoke modes passed:
- `usage-examples-duplicate-count-mode-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard`
- `usage-examples-duplicate-count-mode-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard`
The iter_083 artifacts document execution evidence, validation outcomes, risks/decisions, and one scoped next task for iter_084.
