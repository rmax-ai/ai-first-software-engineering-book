# Summary

Created `iter_063` and completed one migration handoff task from `iter_062`.
Executed `uv run` import validation and live smoke mode for the Copilot SDK path.
Both commands succeeded, with live evidence showing provider/model/content and token usage.
Updated `iter_047` validation artifacts to use current `uv run` evidence and removed stale deferred notes.
No runtime code paths were changed; scope remained documentation/evidence only.
All seven required artifacts for `iter_063` were written.
Recommended next iteration is a targeted cleanup of remaining bare-`python` migration snippets.
