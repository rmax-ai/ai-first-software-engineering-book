# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` defines this as the seed iteration task.
- A concrete plan is required before code changes so future iterations can execute one small improvement at a time.

## Acceptance criteria
1. Document a concise improvement plan covering harness **features**, **tests**, and **eval/regression checks**.
2. Provide a step-by-step backlog that references `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
3. Produce all seven iteration artifacts in `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
