# Validation

## Verification performed
- Confirmed seed-iteration requirements from `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md` were applied.
- Cross-checked plan scope against `DEVELOPMENT.md` harness guidance and target files.
- Verified all seven required artifact files exist under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.

## Observed results
- All required files (`01` through `07`) are present.
- Plan explicitly covers features, tests, and eval/regression expectations.
- No implementation changes were made, matching planning-only scope.

## Acceptance criteria status
- ✅ Concise improvement plan created.
- ✅ Required target files and eval surfaces are named.
- ✅ Exactly one next task prepared with concrete criteria.
