# Iteration summary

- Created seed iteration folder `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/` and produced all seven required artifacts.
- Selected and documented the story: plan custom harness improvements.
- Grounded the plan in `DEVELOPMENT.md` and current harness surfaces under `state/`.
- Defined a concrete feature backlog centered on deterministic tracing, role I/O scaffold clarity, and smoke coverage.
- Mapped verification strategy to UV-run smoke commands and explicit eval contract alignment in `evals/*.yaml`.
- Logged key risks, decisions, and deferred implementation boundaries for traceable handoff.
- Recommended exactly one next task with measurable acceptance criteria and explicit files to modify.
