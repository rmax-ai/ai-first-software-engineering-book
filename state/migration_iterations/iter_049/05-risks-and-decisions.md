# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Older (non-recent) iteration folders still contain historical bare `python` snippets.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Updated only recent iterations 044–046 for a minimal, scoped change aligned to prior guidance.
- Avoided broader historical rewrites in this iteration to keep one-task scope.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Full backfill across older iteration folders remains deferred.
