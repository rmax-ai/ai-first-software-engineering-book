# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Other historical iteration artifacts may still contain legacy `python state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` snippets.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Per runner rules, executed only the one highest-priority task from `iter_085/06-next-iteration.md`.
- Committed the code change immediately after validation to satisfy auto-commit requirements.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Broader cleanup of remaining legacy snippet mentions outside this one-task scope.
