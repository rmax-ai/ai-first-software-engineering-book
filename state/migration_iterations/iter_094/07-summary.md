# Summary

This iteration executed exactly one migration-plan task from the prior handoff.
The work normalized one acceptance-criteria wording line in `state/migration_iterations/iter_092/01-task.md`.
Only the trailing evidence phrase in line 10 changed; command text remained intact.
Targeted `rg` checks confirmed normalized wording presence and no broader drift for the task surface.
`git --no-pager diff` showed a one-line modification in the target file before commit.
A complete seven-file artifact handoff was written under `state/migration_iterations/iter_094/`.
The next iteration recommends the same one-line cleanup pattern in `iter_093/01-task.md`.
This preserves minimal-diff discipline and the established smallest-task cadence.
