# Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
No prior `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` exists, so this seed iteration establishes a concrete backlog for incremental harness work.

## Acceptance criteria
- Define concise feature improvements for `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, and harness observability.
- Define targeted tests with concrete commands (including `uv run python state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`).
- Define eval alignment with specific files in `evals/` and expected signals in `state/metrics.json`.
- Provide exactly one next iteration task in `06-next-iteration.md`.
