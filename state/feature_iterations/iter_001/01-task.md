# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- The feature backlog execution prompt requires a seed planning iteration before implementation.
- A concrete plan is needed to sequence low-risk, verifiable updates across `state/` and `evals/`.
- Capturing acceptance criteria now reduces drift in later implementation iterations.

## Acceptance criteria
- Define concise planned feature improvements for the harness, including observability and deterministic controls.
- Define targeted tests to validate those planned features.
- Define evaluation coverage tied to existing `evals/*.yaml` signals and harness outputs.
- Keep scope limited to planning artifacts only (no harness code changes in this iteration).
