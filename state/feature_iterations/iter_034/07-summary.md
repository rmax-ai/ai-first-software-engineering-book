# Summary

This iteration executed the queued task from `iter_033/06-next-iteration.md`.
A new deterministic guard mode was added in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` for `usage-examples-duplicate-count-mode-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard-coverage-guard`.
The mode was registered in `DETERMINISTIC_MODE_SPECS` so argparse choices and generated usage examples both include it.
Validation used the required two smoke commands.
Both commands passed and confirmed expected coverage behavior.
All seven `iter_034` artifacts were written with task, plan, execution, validation, risks, next-step, and summary handoff.
The next recommended task continues the guard-chain with one additional `coverage-guard` suffix.
