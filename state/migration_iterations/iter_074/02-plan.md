# Plan

1. Confirm the legacy fallback-error snippet mention exists in `state/migration_iterations/iter_072/01-task.md`.
2. Apply a one-line markdown edit to normalize wording to `uv run python ...`.
3. Run targeted `rg` checks and a scoped git diff command to validate the exact change.
4. Record execution, validation, risks/decisions, next-iteration handoff, and summary artifacts for this iteration.
