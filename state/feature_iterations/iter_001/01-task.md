# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
- No prior `state/feature_iterations/` handoff exists, so this seed iteration must establish an executable backlog for harness improvements.
- The backlog needs clear feature/test/eval mapping before implementation iterations touch `state/kernel.py` and related harness assets.

## Acceptance criteria
1. Document a concise improvement story covering harness features, tests, and eval regression signals.
2. Produce a step-by-step plan that names concrete files to change in future iterations.
3. Define one next task with explicit acceptance criteria and expected files.
