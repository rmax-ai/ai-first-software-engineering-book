# Task: Plan custom state harness improvements

## Why this task now
The feature-iteration backlog is empty, and the execution prompt requires a seed planning iteration that defines concrete harness improvements before implementation work begins.

## Acceptance criteria
- Provide a concise improvement plan that explicitly covers features, tests, and eval/regression checks.
- Reference the intended change surfaces: `state/kernel.py`, `state/role_io_templates.py`, `state/copilot_sdk_uv_smoke.py`, and `evals/*.yaml`.
- Produce all seven required iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`.
