# Summary

This iteration executed one migration-plan cleanup task from the prior handoff.
The task normalized the remaining fallback-error command reference in `state/migration_iterations/iter_065/06-next-iteration.md`.
The content edit was intentionally minimal (2-line delta in one file).
Targeted validation used `rg` checks plus commit evidence from `5565464`.
All seven required iteration artifacts were written under `state/migration_iterations/iter_067/`.
No runtime code or interfaces changed.
The next recommended task targets one adjacent legacy bare snippet mention in `iter_064/06-next-iteration.md`.
