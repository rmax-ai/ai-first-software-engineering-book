# Summary

This iteration executed one backlog task from `iter_120/06-next-iteration.md`.
A new smoke guard mode was added to assert the latest adjacency guard mode appears immediately before the related uniqueness guard mode.
The mode was registered with deterministic description text in the trace-summary mode sequence.
No unrelated logic or interfaces were changed.
Targeted verification ran with the new mode and returned PASS with exit code 0.
All seven required artifacts for `iter_121` were written in `state/feature_iterations/iter_121/`.
The next iteration recommends uniqueness hardening for the newly added adjacency mode.
