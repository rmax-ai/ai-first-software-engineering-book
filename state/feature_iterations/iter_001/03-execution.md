# Execution

## Commands and tools run
- Read prompt and governance context with `view`:
  - `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Iteration discovery with `glob`:
  - `state/feature_iterations/iter_*` (no prior iterations found)
- Session planning and repo check with `bash`:
  - `git --no-pager status --short`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/04-validation.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/05-risks-and-decisions.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
- Established the seed planning iteration required by the execution prompt.
- Captured a concrete backlog framing features/tests/evals before implementation work begins.
