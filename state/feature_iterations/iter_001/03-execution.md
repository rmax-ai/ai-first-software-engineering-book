## Commands/tools run
- Read prompt contract: `prompts/incremental-improvements/execute.md`
- Read governance guidance: `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Checked for prior iterations: `glob state/feature_iterations/iter_*`
- Created iteration artifacts under `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/`

## Files changed
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/01-task.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/02-plan.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/03-execution.md`

- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/06-next-iteration.md`
- `state/feature_iterations/iter_001/07-summary.md`

## Rationale
This is the required seed planning iteration, so the only repository changes are concise planning artifacts that define feature/test/eval backlog and a single concrete next task.
