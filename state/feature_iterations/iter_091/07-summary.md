# Summary

This iteration completed one smallest unfinished task in the duplicate-count coverage-guard cleanup track.
The final direct long-suffix wrapper implementation in `state/copilot_sdk_smoke_test.py` was migrated to `_run_usage_examples_duplicate_count_mode_coverage_guard(...)`.
No PASS text was changed.
Targeted smoke validations for the adjacent 22-guard and 23-guard modes both passed.
Artifacts `01` through `07` were created for iteration `iter_091` with execution and validation evidence.
The next recommended task is a regression guard ensuring wrappers in this family stay helper-delegated.
