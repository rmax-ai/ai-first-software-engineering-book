# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Older iteration artifacts may still intentionally contain bare-command examples in historical validation logs.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Kept this iteration narrowly scoped to the exact handoff-targeted file (`iter_065/06-next-iteration.md`).
- Avoided broader historical rewrites to preserve minimal diff and one-task-per-iteration discipline.

## Intentionally deferred
- Broader audit/normalization of historical bare-command references outside the selected task.
