# Risks and Decisions

## Risks discovered
- Iteration guidance in `iter_074/06-next-iteration.md` referenced an already-complete fallback-error target, creating minor ambiguity.

## Decisions made and trade-offs
- Chose the closest unfinished normalization in `iter_071/01-task.md` to stay within the same minimal cleanup stream.
- Kept scope to a one-line text normalization to avoid unrelated churn.

## Anything intentionally deferred
- Additional historical snippet normalizations outside the selected file were intentionally deferred to later iterations.
